A CLI and TUI for [HEY](https://hey.com).

*Read and send emails, manage boxes, calendars, todos, habits, time tracking, and journal entries — all from your terminal.*

## Install

**macOS / Linux / WSL2**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hey.com/install-cli | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://hey.com/install-cli.ps1 | iex
```

On Windows 11 with Smart App Control, see [Troubleshooting](#windows-smart-app-control-and-smartscreen) if the install is blocked.

## Getting started

```bash
hey
```

The first time you run `hey` at a terminal it walks you through setup: it signs you in
(browser-based OAuth), shows the mail accounts linked to your HEY identity, and offers to
connect your coding agents (Claude Code, Codex). After that, `hey tui` opens the app and
bare `hey` prints the help. `hey setup` reruns the wizard any time; `hey login` and
`hey logout` are shortcuts for `hey auth login` and `hey auth logout`.

Logged-out data commands at a terminal (`hey boxes`, say) offer to sign you in on the spot.
Piped or `--json` runs never prompt: they fail with `Not logged in` (exit 3) so scripts and
agents can handle it.

Both scripts download the release for your platform, verify its SHA-256 checksum, and — when `cosign` is installed — verify the release's keyless Sigstore signature (cosign v3 as-is, v2.6+ with `--new-bundle-format=true`; older versions skip signature verification with a warning). Set `HEY_VERSION` to pin a release and `HEY_BIN_DIR` to choose the install directory.

<details>
<summary>Other installation methods</summary>

**Homebrew (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
brew install --cask basecamp/tap/hey
```

**Arch Linux / Omarchy (AUR):**
```bash
yay -S hey-cli
```

**Linux (deb/rpm/apk):**
```bash
# Download from https://github.com/basecamp/hey-cli/releases/latest
sudo apt install ./hey-cli_*_linux_amd64.deb                 # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install ./hey-cli_*_linux_amd64.rpm                 # Fedora/RHEL
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted ./hey-cli_*_linux_amd64.apk   # Alpine
```
Arm64: substitute `arm64` for `amd64` in the filename. Verify the SHA-256 checksum from `checksums.txt` before installing unsigned Alpine packages.

**Scoop (Windows):**
```powershell
scoop bucket add basecamp https://github.com/basecamp/homebrew-tap
scoop install hey
```

**Nix:**
```bash
nix profile install github:basecamp/hey-cli
```

**Go install:**
```bash
go install github.com/basecamp/hey-cli/cmd/hey@latest
```

**From source** (requires Go 1.26+; [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) installs the right version):
```bash
mise install       # install Go 1.26
make install       # build and install into /usr/local/bin/hey
```

**GitHub Release:** download from [Releases](https://github.com/basecamp/hey-cli/releases). Every release ships `checksums.txt` and a keyless Sigstore signature `checksums.txt.bundle`, verifiable with:
```bash
cosign verify-blob --bundle checksums.txt.bundle \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/basecamp/hey-cli/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v<VERSION>" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com checksums.txt
```
That command is for cosign v3. With cosign v2.6–v2.x add `--new-bundle-format=true`; older versions cannot verify the bundle.

</details>

## Upgrading

```bash
hey upgrade
hey upgrade 0.2.0-rc.1   # target a specific release, e.g. a prerelease
```

Upgrading only ever moves forward: a requested version at or below the installed one is a
no-op, and package-manager installs always follow their manager's own version (a pinned
version is refused there).

What happens depends on how hey was installed:

- **Installer script / tarball** (a binary under your home directory, e.g. `~/.local/bin` or `~/bin`): upgrades in place. hey downloads the release for your platform, verifies its Sigstore signature (the keyless `checksums.txt.bundle` published by the release pipeline, identity-pinned to the release workflow and tag) and SHA-256 checksum, swaps the executable transactionally, and confirms the installed binary reports the new version. On failure the previous binary is restored; in the worst case — restoration itself fails mid-swap — the error names the preserved backup file next to the binary so you can put it back by hand.
- **Homebrew / Scoop**: delegates to `brew upgrade --cask basecamp/tap/hey` / `scoop update hey`, then verifies the manager-installed binary actually reports the new version.
- **System packages** (apt/dnf/apk, AUR, Nix) and **`go install` builds**: never touched. `hey upgrade` exits nonzero with upgrade guidance for that install method (the exact command where it can be known, e.g. `go install` or `yay -S hey-cli`; otherwise which package manager to use).

`hey upgrade` exits 0 only when there is no update, or the update was applied *and confirmed*. Every other outcome is a structured failure (`"ok": false` in JSON) with one of these codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `upgrade_required` | An update exists but hey won't apply it for this install method (or this is not a release build) — the hint carries the right next step |
| `upgrade_incomplete` | The package manager exited 0 but the binary still reports the old version |
| `upgrade_unverified` | The upgrade may have worked, but the installed version could not be confirmed |
| `upgrade_failed` | The update check, download, signature/checksum verification, or executable swap failed — the previous binary remains installed (or the error names the preserved backup if restoration also failed) |

`hey version` prints the installed version; `hey version --json` adds the commit, build date, Go version and build source (`release`, `go install` or `dev`). `hey doctor` warns when a newer release is available.

## Authentication

```bash
# Browser-based OAuth against HEY's own OAuth server (primary method)
hey auth login

# Or use a pre-generated token
hey auth login --token TOKEN

# Or use a browser session cookie
hey auth login --cookie COOKIE
```

Tokens refresh automatically on expiry. Credentials are stored in the system keyring (with file fallback at `~/.config/hey-cli/credentials.json`).

```bash
hey auth status   # check auth status
hey auth token    # print the bearer token for scripting (refuses a --cookie login)
hey auth refresh  # force token refresh
hey auth logout   # clear credentials
```

`hey login` and `hey logout` are top-level shortcuts for `hey auth login` and `hey auth logout`.

### Linked accounts

One HEY login exposes every mail account linked to that identity. List the available
filters, persist a default, or select one for a single invocation:

```bash
hey accounts list                 # list All Accounts and each linked account
hey accounts use 12345            # persist a linked account as the default mail filter
hey accounts use all              # return to All Accounts
hey --account 12345 boxes         # override the default for one invocation
HEY_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 hey search "quarterly planning"
```

The default is `all`. Selection precedence is `--account`, `HEY_ACCOUNT_ID`, trusted local
`.hey/config.json`, the global default for the active server, then All Accounts. Global
account defaults are stored separately for each server origin, so development and production
selections cannot affect one another. Explicit and persisted IDs are validated against the
signed-in identity before mail requests, so an unavailable account fails closed.

The first command that would use a repository-local server or account setting asks whether to
use it once, always trust its current values, or cancel. Non-interactive and JSON commands fail
closed until you explicitly run `hey config trust-local` from that directory. Changes to the
local server or account invalidate trust. Review trust with `hey config trusted-locals` and
remove it with `hey config untrust-local`.

Compose and contact creation use an individually selected account; replies and forwards use
the thread's account. Calendars, todos, habits, time tracking, and journal entries remain
identity-wide.

## TUI

Run `hey tui` to launch the interactive terminal UI (it offers to sign you in first if
needed). Bare `hey` prints the help — or, logged out at a terminal, runs first-time setup.
For identities with multiple linked mail accounts, press Ctrl+A to switch between All
Accounts and individual email addresses.
Switching cancels requests from the previous account and reloads the active section;
Calendar and Journal remain identity-wide.

Navigate between Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and Journal. The context-sensitive shortcut bar is visible by default; press `?` to hide or restore it, and the choice is remembered across restarts. Mail navigation includes HEY boxes plus separate Labels and Collections tabs; Shift+K opens Collections directly, while Labels remains available from the navigation row. Every list keeps going: scroll towards the bottom of a box, label, or collection and the next threads are read in behind you, so there are no pages to step through. The mail actions use HEY's web shortcuts in either letter case: `/` or `s` searches, `r` replies, `f` forwards, `v` moves, `b` manages labels, `n` adds or removes the selected thread from collections, `e` marks seen, `u` marks unseen, `i` moves to the Imbox, `l` moves to Reply Later, `a` moves to Set Aside, `d` moves to The Feed, `p` moves to Paper Trail, and `t` trashes. Press `!` to mark as spam, `-` to ignore, and `+` to stop ignoring. Select threads with Space and press Ctrl+B to preview every bulk-reply recipient before writing and sending one reply to all selected threads. A delayed bulk reply can be recalled with Ctrl+U while HEY's undo window remains open. Search results retain the matching-message summary and keep going as you scroll, like every other list.

The mail list follows the server. HEY tells the TUI when a box changed over the same
Action Cable connection `hey watch` uses, and the box on screen is read again a moment
later, keeping your place in the list and anything you had selected. A change that arrives
while a form or a picker is open waits for it to close. Press Ctrl+R to read the box again
yourself; if the connection goes away for good, the list says so and Ctrl+R is how you
catch up.

The Screener keeps up too. When a first-time sender writes, the count above the threads
changes on its own, and if you have The Screener open the new sender appears in the queue
without moving your place in it.

Press Ctrl+S from the mail list to open The Screener. When senders are waiting, the mail
list says so above the threads. In The Screener, `y` screens the selected sender in and `n`
screens them out, Tab moves to Screener History and back, `X` clears the whole Screener
after a confirmation, and Escape or `q` returns to mail. Both lists keep going as you
scroll, the same way the mail list does.

The Imbox can wear cover art, the way the HEY web app does: everything you have already
read goes under it, so the box ends at what still wants your attention instead of trailing
off into a month of receipts. The divider stays and says how much is under there — press
`x` to peek, `x` again to close it.

Press Ctrl+V to choose one: `blobs`, `grid`, `peace`, `terrazzo`, `topo` or `waves`, the
same six covers redrawn as characters, so they work in any terminal rather than only the
ones that can show images. The picker draws whichever you have highlighted. They are
painted in your terminal's own colors, so a cover matches your theme and follows it when
you switch.

Your choice is remembered in `~/.config/hey-cli/config.json`, on this machine. It is not
the cover you picked on the web: HEY keeps that one server-side but serves it to nobody, so
the iOS and Android apps each keep their own local choice too, and this is the same.

Thread attachments always appear with their filename, media type, and size. Use `[` and `]` to select an attachment, `s` to save it without replacing an existing file, and `o` to download and open it in an external application. Attachments never open automatically. Kitty and Ghostty can show inline images. Foot and other terminals use visible text markers.

Press Shift+O to open Contacts. Use Enter to view a contact, `a` to add, `e` to edit, `n` to edit the private note, `x` twice to delete a note, `h` to hide, and `u` to show the most recently hidden contact again. Escape or `q` goes back.

Press Shift+C to open Calendar, then `c` to manage time track categories. Create a category with `n`, rename the selected category with Enter or `r`, and press `x` twice to delete it. Time tracks in a deleted category become uncategorized.

In Calendar, press `a` to create a habit. Habits visible in the current calendar range can be selected with `[` and `]`, edited with `e`, and deleted by pressing `x` twice. Habit forms use Tab to move between fields and Ctrl+S to save.

## CLI Commands

Structured data commands support `--json` for full output and `--jq '<expression>'` to
filter that output without an external `jq` binary. `--jq` implies `--json` and filters
the full success envelope; combine it with `--quiet` to filter result data directly.
Errors retain their complete structured envelope. Commands with dedicated raw output
(`auth token`, `completion`, `skill`, `tui`, and `--version`) reject `--jq`.

Use `--base-url` to override the server URL and `--account <id|all>` to select a linked
mail account.

```bash
hey boxes --jq '.data[] | {id, name}'
hey boxes --quiet --jq '.[].id'
```

Listing commands also answer `--markdown` for a table, `--styled` to force the human
rendering when the output is piped, `--ids-only` for one ID per line, and `--count` for a
bare number. `--ids-only` and `--count` need list data, so they work on `hey boxes`,
`hey box`, `hey labels`, `hey label`, `hey collections`, `hey collection`, `hey workflows`,
`hey workflow`, `hey drafts`, `hey search`, `hey contacts list`, `hey screener list`, `hey screener history`, `hey calendars`,
`hey recordings`, `hey todo list`, `hey timetrack list` and `hey journal list`. The
data-only formats print any pagination notice on stderr, so the IDs on stdout stay
pipeable.

`--html` writes the original HTML, for the commands that hold some: `hey threads`,
`hey journal read`, `hey contacts show` and `hey contacts note show`. It is a format of
its own — it cannot be combined with the other output flags (`--stats` included: there is
no envelope to carry stats), every other command refuses it, and it is meant for a file or
a pipe: on a terminal it is refused with the redirect spelled out, since markup on a
terminal is neither readable nor safe.

A thread is written as one HTML5 document, so a downstream tool can parse it rather than
split it: `<!doctype html>`, `<html lang="en">`, a `<head>` with `<meta charset="utf-8">`
and `<title>Thread N</title>`, then in `<body>` one
`<article id="entry-ID" data-entry-id="ID" data-created-at="…" data-body-state="…">` per
entry, oldest first. Each article opens with a `<header>` naming the sender and the date
(HTML-escaped) and then holds the entry's HTML exactly as HEY served it. An entry without
a body holds only its header, and `data-body-state` says why — `bodyless` when HEY served
none, `over_limit` or `failed` when the load left it unread, `hydrated` when it was read
and was empty. A thread that could only be read in part is refused as for every other
format; with `--allow-partial` the document ends with the notice in an HTML comment
(`<!-- notice: … -->`) just before `</body>`, and the notice goes to stderr as well.

A single body — a journal entry, a contact's note — is written as a fragment instead: the
HTML as HEY served it, nothing for an empty one. A thread has entries to frame; one body
is what gets pasted into something else.

```

`hey threads` reads a whole thread, oldest entry first, however many pages HEY serves it in — within limits it states: a hundred pages past the first, two thousand entries, as many bodies, 64 MiB of content and two minutes in all. A thread that could only be read in part — a body HEY would not serve, a limit reached — is refused rather than passed off as whole; `--allow-partial` takes what was read, with a `notice` saying what is missing and each entry's `body_state` saying whether its body was `hydrated`, `bodyless` (HEY served none), `over_limit` or `failed`. `--count` and `--ids-only` read the entry index and no bodies, so only a truncated index can make them partial. `--markdown` writes the thread as one Markdown document — a heading per entry naming the sender, date and ID, then the body — which is the shape to hand an agent or a notes app. `hey attachments` reads the bodies in every format, since that is where attachment metadata lives, and answers a partial thread the same way. `hey reply` answers the thread's latest entry and addresses the reply the way HEY does: everyone that entry was addressed to, plus whoever wrote it.

Email bodies come back as Markdown. `hey threads` and the TUI render that Markdown for the terminal — headings, emphasis, lists, quotes, tables and code survive, and links keep their URLs and stay clickable where the terminal supports it. `--json` carries the same Markdown in `body`, so an agent reading a thread sees the structure a human sees rather than a flattened wall of text. `--html` still returns HEY's original HTML.

`hey share <thread_id>` gets a sharing link for a thread. Anyone with the link can see the entire thread and future emails or replies sent to it. `hey unshare <thread_id>` turns off the sharing link.

Search accepts free text plus `--required`, `--any`, `--none`, `--exact`, `--from`, `--to`, `--subject`, `--date`, `--in`, `--label`, and `--attachment`. `--in`, `--date`, `--label` and `--attachment` take one of the values `hey search filters` lists — the attachment kinds are `any`, `images`, `pdfs`, `calendar_invites`, `documents`, `spreadsheets`, `presentations`, `media` and `zip_files`, so it is `--attachment pdfs` rather than `pdf`, and an unrecognized `--in`, `--date` or `--attachment` is refused with the values it accepts before anything is sent. Use `--page` for one page or `--all` to fetch up to 100 pages; capped searches report the next page for continuation. Search results include `topic_id` for reading the thread and the matching message summaries. Results with an active box item also include `id` for organization actions.

Contact updates preserve omitted name, email, and alias fields. Supplying `--alias` replaces the complete alias list; `--alias=` clears it. Contact notes accept positional content, `--note`, stdin, or `$EDITOR`. HEY hides contacts rather than permanently deleting them; hidden contacts leave lists, autocomplete, and search, and can be shown again by ID. Bundling groups a contact's mail into one row without merging or deleting the underlying threads; unbundling lists those threads separately again. HEY applies bundling when the contact's current delivery setting supports bundles.

The Screener is where first-time senders wait. `hey screener list` returns clearance IDs — not contact IDs — with the sender and the subject of what they sent, plus `topic_id` for reading the thread before deciding. `--count` asks for the number alone, which is a far cheaper request than the queue, and prints it as a bare number like every other command's `--count`, so `n=$(hey screener list --count)` reads it directly. Approving delivers everything the sender has waiting; denying hides it. Either is reversible with the opposite command, and `hey screener history` shows what was already decided. `--box` and `--seen` approve one sender at a time; several IDs go through HEY's bulk endpoint, which takes neither. `--spam` also trains HEY's filter, which is harder to undo than denying. `hey screener clear` empties the queue without deciding anything — those senders reappear on their next email.

`hey bulk-reply preview` is read-only and resolves each posting to its latest replyable entry. `hey bulk-reply send` resolves the selection again, skips threads without a replyable entry, keeps HEY's server-provided name tag, and returns the exact reply count, delivery ID, delayed state, undo URL, and undo command. Posting IDs must be positive and unique. The message can come from `-m`, stdin, or `$EDITOR`; `--attach` is repeatable.

`--attach` is repeatable on `hey compose`, `hey reply`, and `hey bulk-reply send`, and attachment-only messages are supported. The CLI validates and uploads every file before sending the email. `hey attachments <topic_id>` returns stable message-and-position IDs such as `456:1`; pass an ID to `hey attachments save`. Saving uses the original filename by default, accepts `--output` for a file or directory, and preserves existing files unless `--force` is set.

Organization actions take the `id` values returned by `hey box --json`, `hey label --json`, or `hey search --json`. Reading, replying to, and forwarding a thread take its `topic_id` instead, which `hey box --json`, `hey label --json`, `hey collection --json` and `hey search --json` all carry alongside `id`. `hey box` also returns `next_page` and accepts `--page <next_page>` to continue a box listing; it keeps `next_history_url` for the sync clients that read it, and `--page` accepts that URL as readily as the cursor inside it. Label IDs come from `hey labels`; `hey label` returns `next_page` and `total_count`, accepts `--page <next_page>` for continuation, and supports `--all` for complete traversal. HEY creates a label while adding it to at least one thread, so `hey label create` requires thread item IDs.

Collection IDs come from `hey collections`. `hey collection` returns both each posting `id` and its `topic_id`, plus `next_page` and `total_count`. Collection membership commands take `topic_id`; posting organization commands continue to take `id`. Creating a collection returns a confirmed mutation, and `hey collections` provides its ID for subsequent commands. Collection updates accept a non-empty name, summary, or both.

Workflow IDs come from `hey workflows`, which includes the linked account ID for each workflow. `hey workflow <id>` returns stages in position order; `--ids-only` and `--count` apply to those stages. Creating a workflow needs one linked mail account, selected with `--account` when more than one is available. HEY creates new stages as `Untitled`, so create the stage, read its ID with `hey workflow <id>`, then rename it. Workflow membership commands take `topic_id`. Adding a thread creates its workflow membership before selecting the requested stage; if stage selection fails, the thread remains in the workflow's first stage and the command reports the error.

`hey box <name|id>`, `hey label <id>` and `hey collection <id>` list the same postings and answer the same formats: `--json`, `--styled`, `--markdown`, `--ids-only`, and `--count`. The data-only formats print the pagination notice and any `next_page` cursor on stderr, so the IDs on stdout stay pipeable. `--json` differs only in what wraps the postings: a box answers with HEY's box payload, a label and a collection with the source and its `total_count`.

Move destinations are Imbox, The Feed, Set Aside, Reply Later, or Paper Trail. Bubble Up requires a scheduled date and is not available through `hey move`. Trashing a shared thread removes your access instead of deleting it for everyone. Ignored threads remain in their box and can be restored with `hey stop-ignoring`.

### Watching for changes

```bash
hey watch                               # follow every box, a line of JSON per change
hey watch --box imbox --events added    # only new postings in the Imbox
hey watch --box imbox --exit-on-first   # block until something lands, then exit
hey watch --since 2026-08-18T09:00:00Z  # catch up from a time first, then follow
hey watch --run-async 'notify-send "New mail in $HEY_BOX_KIND"'
hey watch --run-sync ./triage.sh        # one at a time, waiting for each
```

Runs until interrupted, printing changes as they happen, one line each:

```json
{"change":"added","at":"2026-08-18T09:14:22.031Z","box":{"id":24088,"kind":"imbox","name":"Imbox"},"posting_id":98765,"thread_id":54321,"posting":{}}
```

A change can drive a command instead of being printed, and there's a choice to make
between two behaviours — pass one or the other, not both. `--run-async` spawns the
command per change and moves on, so a slow one never holds up the watch and two can
overlap. `--run-sync` waits for each and runs them in order, so they never overlap and a
slow one delays the next.

Both hand the JSON to the command on its stdin, and the same fields as `HEY_CHANGE`,
`HEY_AT`, `HEY_BOX_ID`, `HEY_BOX_KIND`, `HEY_BOX_NAME`, `HEY_POSTING_ID` and
`HEY_THREAD_ID`. Both also take over stdout, so the JSON isn't printed as well.

### Calendars

```bash
hey calendars                      # list calendars and their IDs
hey recordings 123              # list this calendar's entries from today onward
hey recordings 123 --starts-on 2026-01-01 --ends-on 2026-01-31  # over a date range
hey recordings 123 --count      # how many entries, across every type
```

Calendar IDs come from `hey calendars`. `--starts-on` defaults to today and `--ends-on` to
thirty days after it; both want `YYYY-MM-DD`, and an unreadable date or an `--ends-on`
before `--starts-on` is a usage error rather than an empty result. `hey recordings` groups
its entries by type, so `--limit` caps each type separately while `--count` and
`--ids-only` read across all of them.

### Todos

```bash
hey todo list                      # list todos
hey todo add "Buy milk"            # create a todo
hey todo complete 1                # mark done
hey todo uncomplete 1              # mark undone
hey todo delete 1                  # delete
```

### Habits

```bash
hey habit create "Morning strength training"  # create every day with weights and blue defaults
hey habit create "Practice piano" --icon music --color green --days mon,wed,fri
hey habit edit 1 --name "Evening strength training"  # edit only the supplied fields
hey habit edit 1 --days 0,6         # Sunday and Saturday (names also work)
hey habit delete 1                  # permanently delete the habit and its history
hey habit complete 1                # mark habit done (today or --date YYYY-MM-DD)
hey habit uncomplete 1              # undo habit completion
```

Habit IDs come from calendar recordings. Weekdays use `0` for Sunday through `6` for Saturday; full names and common abbreviations are accepted too.

### Time tracking

```bash
hey timetrack start                # start tracking
hey timetrack stop                 # stop tracking
hey timetrack current              # show active track
hey timetrack list                 # list all tracks
hey timetrack export > tracked-time.csv
hey timetrack export --output tracked-time.csv
hey timetrack categories           # list categories
hey timetrack category create "Client work"
hey timetrack category rename 123 "Planning"
hey timetrack category delete 123
```

The time tracking export contains every completed entry, newest first, with Start, End, Duration, Category, and Notes columns. Ongoing time tracking is excluded. `--output` preserves an existing file unless `--force` is set.

Without `--output` the CSV goes to stdout as CSV, so redirecting it to a file is the whole
recipe. The output formatting flags have nothing to reshape there and are refused rather
than ignored: `--json`, `--quiet`, `--markdown`, `--ids-only`, `--count` and `--html` all
need `--output`, which returns file metadata they can format.

### Journal

```bash
hey journal list                   # list entries
hey journal read                   # read today's entry (or pass YYYY-MM-DD)
hey journal write "..."            # write today's entry (or omit content for $EDITOR)
```

Saving an empty buffer in `$EDITOR` removes the day's entry, and `hey journal write` says
so rather than reporting a save. An empty day answers with an empty entry, so if the read
that pre-fills the editor fails for any other reason the command stops there instead of
opening a blank buffer over an entry it could not see.

## Omarchy

On [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) the TUI follows the active theme with no setup: it lays
the theme's `accent`, `selection`, `muted`, `foreground` and `red` over its ANSI palette,
read from `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/`, and restyles live when you run
`omarchy theme set`. Set `HEY_THEME=/path/to/file.toml` to use your own overlay anywhere
— an explicitly chosen file is trusted as written — or `NO_COLOR=1` to turn color off.

```bash
yay -S hey-cli               # hey-cli is on the AUR
hey setup omarchy            # install into the desktop
hey setup omarchy --notify   # also toast new Imbox mail (--no-notify turns it off)
hey setup omarchy --remove   # take it all out again
```

Setup installs a `HEY TUI` launcher entry, a `HEY` row in the SUPER+SPACE menu, a bar
indicator that lights when the Imbox has unread mail (no count, by design), and a
`hey.toml.tpl` theme template so theme authors can tune the overlay. It prints the
`bindings.lua` snippet for a keybinding rather than editing your file. Omarchy's shipped
HEY web app, its SUPER+SHIFT+E binding and the mailto handler are left untouched.

`--notify` turns on new-mail toasts, off by default: the bar indicator's poll also sends
at most one notification per interval — `Sender — Subject` for one new thread, `N new in
Imbox` for more — replacing the previous toast rather than stacking, and clicking it
focuses the TUI. Omarchy's notification silencing (SUPER+CTRL+comma) mutes them like any
other app. See [docs/omarchy.md](docs/omarchy.md) for the details and what is planned next.

## AI agent integration

hey-cli ships with an embedded agent skill so your coding agent can work with HEY on your
behalf, and a Claude Code plugin (`hey@37signals` from the `basecamp/claude-plugins`
marketplace). The setup wizard offers to connect detected agents; these commands do it on
their own:

```bash
hey setup claude    # install the skill and the hey@37signals plugin for Claude Code
hey setup codex     # install the skill for Codex
hey skill install   # install the skill only (~/.agents/skills/hey, linked for detected agents)
hey setup agents    # non-interactive: skill + a single detected agent (the installer uses this)
hey doctor          # check skill and plugin health per detected agent
```

`hey setup agents` never prompts and never guesses: with several agents detected it installs
the skill only and lists the `hey setup <agent>` choices. `HEY_SETUP_AGENT=claude|codex|all|none`
picks explicitly. `HEY_NONINTERACTIVE=1` disables every prompt (the sign-in offer, the
wizard's confirmations) for harnesses that run hey under a pseudo-terminal. The installed
skill is refreshed automatically the first time a new hey release runs.

hey only ever writes skill directories it owns: each one it creates carries a
`.managed-by-hey-cli` marker, and install, replacement and automatic refresh all refuse a
`hey` skill directory (or symlink) without it — a hand-authored skill at one of those paths
is never overwritten or claimed. `hey doctor` flags an unmanaged baseline and how to adopt it.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
hey doctor           # Check CLI health and diagnose issues
hey config show      # Current settings and where each one came from
hey config set base_url https://app.hey.com
hey version --json   # Installed version, commit, build date and build source
hey upgrade          # Upgrade to the latest release (see Upgrading)
hey commands --json  # Every command, subcommand and flag, for an agent to read
hey completion zsh   # Shell completions (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
```

### Windows: Smart App Control and SmartScreen

To check whether your installed binary is signed:

```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature (Get-Command hey).Source
```

**Smart App Control** (Windows 11) blocks unsigned executables no matter where
they were downloaded from, and it has no per-app exceptions — this applies to
the PowerShell installer, Scoop installs, and manual downloads alike. If it
blocks an unsigned `hey.exe`, two options:

1. **Use WSL2 (preferred).** Install the Linux build inside WSL2 — Smart App
   Control doesn't apply there and your Windows security setup is untouched:
   `wsl --install`, then inside the WSL terminal:
   `curl -fsSL https://hey.com/install-cli | bash`
2. **Turn Smart App Control off** (Windows Security → App & browser control →
   Smart App Control settings) **and leave it off while using the unsigned
   build.** Because there are no per-app exceptions, turning it back on
   re-blocks `hey.exe` on its next run — only re-enable after upgrading to a
   signed build. Windows 11 with the March/April 2026 updates can re-enable
   Smart App Control from Windows Security without a reset; on older builds
   re-enabling requires resetting Windows, so prefer WSL2 there.

**SmartScreen** (without Smart App Control) may warn on first run of an
unrecognized executable — choose "More info" → "Run anyway" if you downloaded
the release from this repository.

## Development

```bash
make build      # build binary
make test       # run tests
make coverage   # run cross-package coverage and enforce the 70.8% floor
make lint       # run golangci-lint
make clean      # remove build artifacts
```

`make coverage` writes `coverage.out`, `coverage.func.txt`, and `coverage.packages.txt`, then prints a concise package summary and the lowest-covered functions.
