/**
 * Broker server — a long-running detached process that multiplexes
 * JSON-RPC messages between socket clients and a single `codex app-server` child.
 *
 * Usage: bun run src/broker-server.ts serve --endpoint <value> [--cwd <path>] [--idle-timeout <ms>]
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Spawns `codex app-server` as a child and connects via stdio
 * - Listens on a Unix socket (or Windows named pipe) for client connections
 * - Forwards JSON-RPC messages between socket clients and the app-server
 * - Exclusive lock: only one client's request streams at a time
 * - Returns error code -32001 when busy
 * - Idle timeout: shuts down after N ms with no activity
 * - Handles SIGTERM/SIGINT gracefully
