name: query
description: Use when the user wants to query or analyze data through the Honeydew semantic layer — including natural language analysis questions, deep multi-step investigations, and structured queries. For model/field discovery use the model-exploration skill.
---

## Prerequisites

Queries run against the workspace and branch set for the current session. Use `get_session_workspace_and_branch` to check the current context. If no workspace/branch is set, use `list_workspaces`, `list_workspace_branches`, and `set_session_workspace_and_branch` to select one. See the `workspace-branch` skill for the full workspace/branch tool reference.

## Overview

Honeydew provides three ways to query data through the semantic layer. Each method suits a different situation — pick the right one based on how well you understand the model and how complex the question is.

| Method                    | Tool                                              | Best For                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structured query**      | `get_data_from_fields` / `get_sql_from_fields`    | Retrieving a specific figure or row set. Deterministic, full control.            |
| **Deep analysis**         | `initiate_analysis` + `monitor_analysis`          | Understanding, explaining, or investigating — anything beyond a lookup.          |
| **Explain a prior step**  | `get_analysis_step_details`                       | User asks how a specific step in a prior analysis was calculated.                |
| **Browse past analyses**  | `list_analysis_chats`                             | User wants to see past conversations or find a prior analysis.                   |
| **Read a past conversation** | `get_stored_conversation`                      | User wants to read or review the full content of a specific past conversation.   |
| **Review query history**  | `list_query_history`                              | User wants to inspect past query executions — what ran, from which client, the query behind a run, or to debug a failure. |

## When to Use Each Method

### 1. Structured Query (`get_data_from_fields` / `get_sql_from_fields`)

**Use when:**

- You know the entity, attribute, and metric names (or can discover them via `list_entities` / `get_entity`)
- You need precise control over filters, ordering, and field selection
- You want deterministic, reproducible results
- You need to validate a newly created metric or attribute
- The user specifies exact fields like "show me `detailed_listings.price` by `detailed_listings.room_type`"

**Do NOT use when:**

- The question requires multi-step reasoning or investigation
- The goal is to understand, explain, or investigate rather than to retrieve a known figure — knowing the field names does not make a structured query the right tool
- You would need several structured queries to assemble the answer — hand the question to deep analysis instead

**How it works:**

- `get_data_from_fields` — executes the query and returns data rows
- `get_sql_from_fields` — returns the generated SQL without executing. Use it when the SQL itself is what's wanted: handing it to the warehouse, dbt, or another tool, or bisecting a failing query to watch a fragment appear and disappear (see the **query-debugging** skill). The output is long machine-generated SQL — to understand what a field computes, read the model with `get_field` / `get_entity` instead

Both take the same field parameters.

### 2. Deep Analysis (`initiate_analysis` + `monitor_analysis`)

**Use when:**

- The goal is to understand, explain, or investigate rather than to retrieve a figure
- The question requires multiple steps or investigative reasoning
- The user asks "why" something happened (e.g., "why did revenue drop in Q3?")
- The user wants trend analysis, anomaly detection, or root cause investigation
- The question is open-ended and may require looking at the data from multiple angles
- Follow-up questions build on prior analysis (use `conversation_id`)
- A figure is wanted whose fields you cannot identify, and finding them would take more work than handing over the question

## Decision Flow

```
User asks a data question
    │
    ├─► User asks to explain / drill into a step from a prior analysis?
    │       └─► get_analysis_step_details (step_id from monitor_analysis)
    │           Returns semantic query, data results, and SQL for that step
    │
    ├─► User wants to browse past conversations / find a prior analysis?
    │       └─► list_analysis_chats (paginated list, newest first)
    │
    ├─► User wants to read the content of a specific past conversation?
    │       └─► get_stored_conversation (conversation_id from list_analysis_chats)
    │
    ├─► User wants to inspect past query executions (what ran / from which client / the query behind a run / a failure)?
    │       └─► list_query_history (filter by status/client/domain/user/time; most recent first)
    │
    ├─► Investigation / "why" / "how" / trends / root cause / anything that
    │   takes more than one query to answer?
    │       └─► initiate_analysis + monitor_analysis
    │           Check this BEFORE the field-names question below — a question
    │           whose fields you happen to know is still an investigation
    │
    └─► Retrieving a specific figure or row set?
            │
            ├─► You know the exact field names → get_data_from_fields
            │         (or get_sql_from_fields to preview SQL without executing)
            │
            └─► You don't → initiate_analysis + monitor_analysis
```

## Method 1: Structured Query

### Field Parameters

A structured query uses flat field parameters to define what data to retrieve:

- **`attributes`** — dimensions to group by (columns in the output), e.g. `["entity.attribute_name"]`
- **`metrics`** — aggregated measures (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.), e.g. `["entity.metric_name"]`
- **`filters`** — row-level filters applied before aggregation, e.g. `["entity.field = 'value'"]`
- **`order_by`** — sort order for results. **Each entry MUST be a quoted string**, as if it were a SQL identifier — e.g. `["\"entity.field\" ASC"]`. Always wrap the field reference in double quotes inside the string.
- **`domain`** — optional domain name for query context
- **`limit`** — max rows to return (default: 100)
- **`offset`** — rows to skip (for pagination)

All fields use `entity.field_name` syntax. Cross-entity fields are supported when relations exist.

### Discovering Fields

Before building a query, discover the available fields:

1. `list_entities` — see all entities
2. `get_entity` with entity name — see its attributes, metrics, and relations
3. `get_field` with entity and field name — get detailed info about a specific field
4. `list_domains` — see all available domains (useful before passing `domain` parameter)
5. `search_model` with a keyword and `search_mode` (`OR` for broad discovery, `EXACT` for known names) — find fields across the model

### Examples

**Simple metric query — total count:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count"]`

**Dimension breakdown — listings by room type:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.room_type"]`
- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"detailed_listings.count\" DESC"]`

**Filtered query — only entire homes:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.neighbourhood_cleansed"]`
- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count"]`
- `filters`: `["detailed_listings.room_type = 'Entire home/apt'"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"detailed_listings.count\" DESC"]`

**Cross-entity query — listings with host info:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.room_type", "dim_host.host_is_superhost"]`
- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"detailed_listings.count\" DESC"]`

**Using aliases — rename fields or ad-hoc expressions:**

You can alias any field or ad-hoc expression using `AS "alias_name"`. This controls the column name in the output.

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.room_type"]`
- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count AS \"total_listings\"", "AVG(detailed_listings.price) AS \"avg_price\""]`
- `order_by`: `["\"total_listings\" DESC"]`

Once aliased, use the alias (not the original expression) in `order_by`.

**Pagination — large result sets:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: (your fields)
- `metrics`: (your metrics)
- `limit`: 50 (max rows to return)
- `offset`: 100 (skip first 100 rows)

**Finding duplicate values:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.host_name"]`
- `metrics`: `["COUNT(detailed_listings.host_name)"]`
- `filters`: `["COUNT(detailed_listings.host_name) > 1"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"COUNT(detailed_listings.host_name)\" DESC"]`

This groups by the attribute, counts occurrences, and filters to only rows that appear more than once — surfacing duplicates.

**SQL preview only:**

Call `get_sql_from_fields` with the same field parameters to see the generated SQL without executing.

### Filter Syntax

Filters use standard comparison expressions: `=`, `>`, `<`, `IN (...)`, `ILIKE`, `SEARCH(...)`, `IS NULL`, booleans, date ranges, and `AND`/`OR` combinations.

> For the complete filter expression reference — including SEARCH, date handling, and type casting — see the **filtering** skill.

## Method 2: Deep Analysis

Deep analysis is a stateful, resumable analyst sub-agent: you delegate a goal to it and monitor it, rather than driving its steps. It plans its own investigation, keeps its own memory (the `conversation_id` is its scratchpad), can pause to ask a clarifying question, and can be aborted and resumed without losing what it has computed. You reach it through a polling loop rather than a single call, so a figure you could pull with a structured query over fields you already know is not worth delegating. The rules below follow from that — hand it the goal rather than a plan, correct it by interrupting and resuming rather than starting over, and open a fresh conversation for an unrelated task rather than putting it in this one's context.

### Asking the Question

State the goal, not the plan. The analyst has context you do not: instructions, knowledge, and conventions held in the semantic layer about which fields, filters, and definitions are correct for a given question. An over-constrained question suppresses that context twice over — the steps you prescribe may be wrong because you are missing it, and a question that already contains a full plan gives the analyst little reason to load it.

- Ask: "What's driving the revenue decline in Q3?"
- Not: "Compare revenue by category and region for Q3 vs Q2, then rank categories by delta."

Add precision through follow-ups instead, once the interpretation and plan come back — by then the analyst has its context loaded and a specific redirection lands on top of it rather than in place of it.

### initiate_analysis + monitor_analysis

Deep analysis is a two-step async process:

**Step 1 — start the analysis:**

Call `initiate_analysis` with:

- `question` (required): the analysis question
- `agent` (required for new conversations): agent name — use `list_agents` to discover available agents and their associated domains. **Workspace and branch must be set before calling `list_agents`** (agents are workspace-scoped)
- `conversation_id` (optional): ID from a previous call, for follow-up questions

Returns a `conversation_id` immediately. New conversations also return a `ui_url` — **always display this URL to the user** so they can follow the analysis in the Honeydew application.

**Step 2 — poll until done:**

Call `monitor_analysis` repeatedly with the `conversation_id` until `status` is `"DONE"`. Each call returns only new messages since the last call.

**`stop_reason` values — what they mean:**

| `stop_reason` | Meaning | What to do |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| `null` | Still running | Keep polling |
| `"DONE"` | Finished normally | Read `responses` array for the final report |
| `"ASK"` | Analysis paused to ask a clarifying question | Read `responses` for the question, answer with a new `initiate_analysis` on the same `conversation_id` |
| `"ABORTED"` | This execution run was stopped | **Not terminal.** Conversation state is preserved — continue with a new `initiate_analysis` on the same `conversation_id` |

**Report progress when it's meaningful to the user** — not every poll, but not silently either. Use judgement:

- On `interpretation` / `plan`: tell the user what the analysis intends to do
- On every `step_insight` with a substantive finding: post a one-liner describing what was found — e.g. *"58 menu items found, top is The King Combo at $431M"*
- If several steps have passed without a user-facing update, post a brief aggregate — e.g. *"Analyzed pricing by neighbourhood, computed averages, filtered outliers"* — so the user knows progress is being made
- On internal errors, retries, or backtracking steps: skip reporting — the user doesn't need to know the agent corrected itself, only that meaningful progress is being made

When `status` is `"DONE"`, the final user-facing report is in the `responses` array.

```
# Example
initiate_analysis(question="What's driving revenue across cuisine types?", agent="my_agent")
→ { conversation_id: "abc123", ui_url: "https://..." }

# Poll loop — report to user after each call that has new content
monitor_analysis(conversation_id="abc123")
→ interpretation + plan received → tell user what the analysis will do

monitor_analysis(conversation_id="abc123")
→ step insight received → report: "Top item is Indian at $1B"

monitor_analysis(conversation_id="abc123")
→ step insight received → report: "% contribution: Indian leads at 34%, followed by Italian at 22%"

...

monitor_analysis(conversation_id="abc123")
→ { status: "DONE", responses: [{ text: "..." }] }
```

### Feedback on a Finished Analysis

`provide_analysis_feedback` attaches feedback to a `conversation_id`:

- **Positive**: a short affirmative string, e.g. `"Good"`
- **Negative**: `<Reason>: <details>` where `Reason` is one of `Chart Issue`, `Data Issue`, `Wrong Judgement`, or `Other` — e.g. `"Data Issue: revenue figures don't match our BI tool"`
- **Clear existing feedback**: pass `null`

There is one entry per conversation, covering the conversation as a whole, and a second call overwrites the first — so **the user's judgement always wins**. Never overwrite feedback the user gave with your own.

**From the user** — trigger when the user says things like: "that was correct", "that's wrong", "the data looks off", "great analysis", "this is incorrect because...". Record what they said.

**On your own initiative** — only from evidence, never from satisfaction. You asked the question, so "it answered what I needed" or "the numbers look plausible" is self-assessment: biased in your own favour, and it dilutes the feedback curators review. What qualifies is a check you can name:

- The result disagrees with, or confirms, an independent source — a structured query over the same fields and filters, a figure the user supplied, a documented value
- A data defect visible in the result — impossible nulls, counts inflated by a fan-out join, two routes to the same number disagreeing
- A conclusion the analysis's own numbers do not support
- A chart that misrepresents the data it plots

Tag it `[agent]` and name the evidence, so a review pass can separate agent-sourced feedback from the user's. Keep `<Reason>:` leading on negative feedback so the reason stays machine-readable:

- `"Data Issue: [agent] reported total revenue 4.2M, but get_data_from_fields on order_detail.revenue with the same date filter returns 3.8M"`
- `"[agent] verified against an independent structured query on order_detail.revenue by menu.item_category for 2021 — figures match"`

With no check to name, leave no feedback. That is a correct outcome, not a skipped step.

### Follow-up Questions

Use `conversation_id` from the previous analysis to ask follow-up questions that build on prior state. **Start a new conversation (omit `conversation_id`) when the topic changes completely** — reusing a conversation for an unrelated question carries stale context into the new analysis and can skew results.

```
initiate_analysis(
  question="Now break this down by room type — does the pattern hold?",
  conversation_id="abc123"
)
```

### Continuing Inside an Analysis

Once a conversation exists, each next question is a choice between a follow-up and dropping out to a structured query.

**Send a follow-up when:**

- The next step needs reasoning rather than a different breakdown — "does the pattern hold if we control for market size?", "why is that outlier there?"
- The next step builds on groups the conversation already computed. A structured query cannot express these ad hoc — ranks, table calculations, filtering on a rank exist as calculated attributes in the model, not as something a query can compute on the fly. A ranking the analysis has already built is reusable for free inside the conversation, and outside it would have to be modelled or rebuilt by hand

**Drop out to `get_data_from_fields` when:**

- You need the raw numbers behind a specific claim the analysis made
- You want another slice of a metric the analysis has already established
- It is a distinct-values or count lookup
- You want a result that is deterministic and reproducible

Only work done inside the conversation shows up at the `ui_url` you gave the user. Numbers you produce with a structured query afterwards won't be there, so report them yourself rather than leaving a gap between what the app shows and what you say.

A finished analysis is also the best source of field names for structured queries: it reports the exact `entity.field` references and filters it used, and `get_analysis_step_details` gives the semantic query behind any step. Feed those attributes, metrics, and filters into `get_data_from_fields` instead of rediscovering them from `list_entities`. The compiled SQL a step also returns is not an input to `get_data_from_fields` — it is for reading or handing to the warehouse.

### Interrupting and Resuming an Analysis

`abort_analysis` with the `conversation_id` stops the current execution run. It is an interrupt, not a cancel: all conversation state survives, including groups already computed. Resume with a new `initiate_analysis` on the same `conversation_id` and the analysis continues from the aborted point, reusing prior results rather than restarting.

**The question you send on resume is the correction.** Interrupt-and-resume is how you steer an analysis mid-flight, rather than waiting for a wrong direction to run to completion and correcting afterwards.

Always abort when the user asks. On your own initiative, the bar is a contradiction with what the user asked for — not a difference from how you would have done it:

- The `interpretation` restates the question as something the user did not ask
- A `step_insight` shows it working from a premise the user's request rules out — a filter that excludes the population in question, a date range other than the one asked about
- The user has since said something that invalidates the direction

A plan that differs from the one you had in mind is not a misread. You handed over the goal because the analyst has context you lack, so an approach you would not have chosen is the expected case rather than a fault. Neither is a step whose purpose isn't obvious yet — the plan may need it later. When the analysis is merely slower or less direct than you would have been, let it finish.

### Explaining a Prior Analysis Step

When the user asks to explain, review, or drill into a specific step (e.g., "how was that calculated?", "explain the cuisine breakdown", "what happened in step 5"):

1. Identify the `step_id` from `monitor_analysis` progress messages (e.g. `"STEP/5"`)
2. Call `get_analysis_step_details` with `conversation_id` and `step_id`

Returns:
- The semantic query used (attributes, metrics, filters)
- Context resolved (which entities/fields Honeydew selected)
- Context items used (if any instructions or knowledge were applied)
- Data results from that step
- The SQL generated for that step

References in the response can be expanded for deeper inspection:
- Field references (e.g. `entity.field_name`) → `get_field` — shows the full definition, useful if the user wants to understand how a metric or attribute is calculated
- Context item references → `get_context_item` — shows the instruction or knowledge applied during that step

### Example Questions

**Simple natural language:**
- "What are the top 10 neighbourhoods by number of listings?"
- "Show me average price by room type."

**Complex analysis:**
- "Why did the average review score drop for listings in Brooklyn?"
- "What factors most influence listing price? Analyze the key drivers."
- "Compare superhost vs non-superhost performance across all metrics."
- "Identify unusual patterns in listing availability over the past year."
- "What are the characteristics of top-performing listings?"

**Step explanation (use `get_analysis_step_details`, not a new question):**
- "How was that calculated?"
- "Explain the cuisine breakdown."
- "Show me what happened in that step."
- "What fields were used there?"

---

## Browsing Past Analyses

### list_analysis_chats

Returns a paginated list of past analysis conversations for the current workspace, sorted newest first.

- Admins see all conversations; non-admins see only their own.
- Each entry includes: `conversation_id`, title, domain, agent, creation time, user feedback, and the display name of the user who created it.
- Use `limit` and `offset` for pagination.

```
list_analysis_chats(limit=20, offset=0)
```

Use this when the user asks to:
- "Show me my recent analyses"
- "Find the analysis I ran last week on revenue"
- "List all conversations in this workspace"

### get_stored_conversation

Returns all messages from a past analysis conversation. Use this to read the full content of a specific conversation identified via `list_analysis_chats`.

- `is_complete` in the response indicates whether the conversation reached a terminal state.
- `with_step_ids: false` (default) — returns only final responses and plan/interpretation messages. Use this for a readable summary.
- `with_step_ids: true` — also includes `step_start` and `step_insight` progress entries. Use this when you need to identify specific steps to pass to `get_analysis_step_details`.

```
get_stored_conversation(conversation_id="abc123")
get_stored_conversation(conversation_id="abc123", with_step_ids=true)
```

---

## Reviewing Past Query Executions

To review or inspect **queries that already ran** — what ran, from which client (BI tools, SQL interface, MCP, deep analysis), the semantic definition or compiled SQL behind a run, who ran it and when, and debugging failures — use `list_query_history` (from the `honeydew` MCP server). It lists queries previously executed through the semantic layer, most recent first, with each query's status, error message, owner, client, domain, timestamps, warehouse query ID, and a link to open it in the app.

This is a distinct workflow from querying data — see the dedicated **query-debugging** skill.

---

## Combining Methods

Methods chain in both directions.

**Discover → query → investigate** — explore the model, spot-check a field with a structured query, then hand the actual question to deep analysis.

**Investigate → query** — let deep analysis answer the question, then use the field names and filters it reports to run fast deterministic cuts of its result. See **Continuing Inside an Analysis** for which direction a given follow-up belongs in.

### Example Workflow

User: "Help me understand pricing patterns for Airbnb listings."

1. Discover entities: `list_entities` → find `detailed_listings`
2. Explore fields: `get_entity` for `detailed_listings` → find `price`, `room_type`, `neighbourhood_cleansed`
3. Targeted query: `get_data_from_fields` → price distribution by neighbourhood for Entire homes only
4. Deep dive: `initiate_analysis` → "What factors most influence listing price?"
5. Follow up on its result: `get_data_from_fields` with the fields the analysis reported → the exact numbers behind the driver it identified

---

## Documentation Lookup

Use the `search_docs` and `query_docs_filesystem` tools from the `honeydew` MCP server to search the Honeydew documentation when:

- The user asks about query capabilities or features not covered in this skill
- You need to understand how the query API interacts with domains, parameters, or governance rules
- The user encounters unexpected query behavior and needs deeper context on how the semantic layer resolves queries

Search for topics like: "queries", "perspectives", "dynamic datasets", "parameters", "query API".

---

## Tip: Getting Distinct Values for a Field

To retrieve the distinct (unique) values of a field, include it in `attributes` and add a count metric in `metrics`.
Use the entity's built-in count metric (e.g., `entity.count`) if available, or an ad-hoc count metric using `COUNT(entity.field)`
on the field whose distinct values you want — never use `COUNT(*)`.
The metric forces aggregation, which groups by the attribute and returns one row per distinct value.

**Example — distinct room types:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.room_type"]`
- `metrics`: `["COUNT(detailed_listings.room_type)"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"COUNT(detailed_listings.room_type)\" DESC"]`

This returns each unique `room_type` along with its count, ordered by frequency. The count is a useful bonus — it tells you how common each value is — but the key point is that the query returns **one row per distinct value**.

This pattern is useful for:

- **Exploring filter values** — find out what values exist before writing a filter expression (see the **filtering** skill)
- **Validating a new attribute** — after creating a calculated attribute, check its distinct output values to confirm the logic is correct (see the **attribute-creation** skill)
- **Understanding data distribution** — see how data is spread across categories

---

## Presenting Results

Present analysis results clearly — format tables, highlight key numbers, and surface what's notable, unexpected, or actionable.

If your environment has visualization tools, render visualizations when they would reveal patterns faster than text — e.g. trends, distributions, or ranked lists of 5+ items. Skip it for 2–3 numbers or a single yes/no conclusion. When it might help but isn't a clear win, offer rather than render.

---

## Best Practices

- **Start with discovery** — always check `list_entities` / `get_entity` before building queries, so you reference real fields
- **Use structured queries for precision** — when you know the fields, `get_data_from_fields` gives you full control and reproducible results
- **Use deep analysis for insight** — anything beyond a lookup goes to `initiate_analysis`: "why", "how", trends, drivers, or any question needing more than one query. Let the analysis engine plan the investigation instead of chaining structured queries by hand
- **Delegate the goal, not the plan** — an over-specified question suppresses the semantic-layer context the analyst would otherwise load, and the steps you prescribe may be wrong precisely because you lack that context. Add precision in follow-ups
- **Stay in the conversation for reasoning, drop out for slices** — follow up when the next step needs reasoning or reuses groups the analysis already computed; use `get_data_from_fields` when you just need deterministic numbers
- **Report meaningful progress, not every step** — surface a one-liner when a step produces a substantive finding; skip internal retries and error-recovery steps the user doesn't need to see
- **Explain a prior step** — use `get_analysis_step_details` with the `step_id`; the response includes the semantic query, data results, and SQL for that step
- **Paginate large results** — use `limit` and `offset` in `get_data_from_fields` to avoid overwhelming output
- **Debug against the model, not the generated SQL** — to understand what a metric or attribute computes, read `get_field` / `get_entity`; the compiled SQL is long machine output and is rarely the shortest route to the answer
- **Reference fields correctly** — always use `entity.field_name` syntax in field parameters
