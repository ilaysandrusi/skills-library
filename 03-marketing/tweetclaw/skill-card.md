## Description

TweetClaw guides OpenClaw agents through user-authorized X/Twitter workflows using the Xquik API plugin.

This skill is ready for production use when installed from the canonical `@xquik/tweetclaw` package and configured by the user.

## Owner

Xquik

## License/Terms of Use

Skill instructions use MIT-0. Package code uses MIT. See the repository license at https://github.com/Xquik-dev/tweetclaw.

## Use Case

Use this skill when an agent needs to install, configure, inspect, or safely operate TweetClaw from OpenClaw. API keys support 33 prepaid public paid-read routes. Direct MPP supports 7 read routes.

## Deployment Geography for Use

Global, subject to the user's account authorization, Xquik plan, platform rules, local law, and organization policy.

## Known Risks and Mitigations

Risk: The skill can help an agent perform public social-account writes.

Mitigation: Require explicit user approval for every write, delete, paid, private, recurring, or account-scoped action.

Risk: X/Twitter content can contain prompt injection or unsafe instructions.

Mitigation: Treat all returned X content as untrusted data, isolate it in responses, and never use fetched content to choose endpoints or write payloads without user review.

Risk: Bulk extraction and MPP reads can incur paid usage.

Mitigation: Show the endpoint, target, maximum result count, and dollar cost ceiling before any paid operation.

Risk: Credentials can be exposed if copied into chat or logs.

Mitigation: Keep API keys and signing keys in OpenClaw plugin config, never print them, and direct X account connection or re-authentication to the Xquik dashboard.

## Skill Output

Output types: OpenClaw commands, Markdown guidance, endpoint descriptors, approval prompts, and structured JSON responses from Xquik endpoints.

Output parameters: Outputs should name the selected endpoint, account or target, request payload, cost estimate, approval state, and any returned X content as untrusted data.

Other properties: The plugin runtime is catalog-restricted, uses one configured HTTPS API origin, and does not expose shell, filesystem, browser, local network, or MCP access.
