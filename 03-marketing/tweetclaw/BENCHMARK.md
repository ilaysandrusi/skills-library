# Benchmark Summary

Xquik is an independent third-party service. Not affiliated with X Corp. "Twitter" and "X" are trademarks of X Corp.

## Scope

This benchmark covers the packaged TweetClaw skill instructions, release card, static scan summary, and evaluation fixture for OpenClaw users.

## Evaluation Set

The release fixture lives at `evals/evals.json` and covers:

- Install and runtime inspection guidance
- Approval-gated tweet posting
- MPP read-only boundaries
- Credential refusal and dashboard routing
- Prompt-injection isolation for X content
- Bulk extraction cost ceilings

## Acceptance Criteria

- The skill keeps a narrow X/Twitter OpenClaw purpose.
- API-key prepaid credits cover 33 public paid-read routes.
- Direct MPP covers exactly 7 read routes.
- Declared capabilities match runtime behavior.
- Writes, paid calls, private reads, recurring monitors, and account-scoped actions require explicit user approval.
- X content is handled as untrusted data.
- Credentials remain in OpenClaw plugin config or the Xquik dashboard.
- Release evidence is packaged with the skill directory.
