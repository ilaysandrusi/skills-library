# Distribb SEO Skill

SEO automation for AI agents. Use any AI model you want. Distribb provides the infrastructure: real keyword data, backlinks from real businesses, a Google Search Console audit, CMS publishing, content calendar, social repurposing and direct social posting, Google Business Profile management (live reviews, public replies, Google posts), Microworkers campaign management, and analytics.

## Quick Start

```bash
export DISTRIBB_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

No installation required for the API. The skill uses `curl` and `jq`. The first time it loads, it walks the user through the proper SEO process: account + onboarding, connect website + Google Search Console, audit, topic clusters, write + backlink, optimize.

## The proper SEO process (what this skill runs)

1. Sign up and complete onboarding at [distribb.io](https://distribb.io) (Distribb learns the business).
2. Connect the two things that matter most: the website/CMS and Google Search Console.
3. Confirm the site has a blog to publish to.
4. **Audit the site before writing anything** (`/gsc-audit`). Available on every plan.
5. Plan topic clusters, then do keyword research to fill them.
6. Write and publish, always including 1-2 backlink-exchange links.
7. Optimize pages stuck on page 2+ using GSC data (`/optimize`).

## Plans

| Plan | Keyword data | Backlinks | Who writes |
|------|---|---|---|
| **Agentic Mode** ($49/mo, 3-day trial) | Distribb-provided | **Unlimited** exchange | You (the agent) |
| **Pro** ($97/mo) | Distribb-provided | Unlimited exchange | Distribb writes + publishes for you |
| **Accelerator** | Distribb-provided | Unlimited exchange | You + done-for-you AI-search distribution |

The free Agentic plan ($0/mo) is deprecated and no longer offered to new users. Current plans are Agentic Mode at $49/month and Pro at $97/month.

Every plan can run the audit and use the content calendar. See [`references/plans-and-backlinks.md`](./references/plans-and-backlinks.md) for full detail. Current pricing is at [distribb.io](https://distribb.io).

## The Audit

Real SEO starts with an audit, not with publishing. `/gsc-audit <domain>` (or [`references/audit-playbook.md`](./references/audit-playbook.md)) runs nine analyses from Distribb's own Search Console connection and a live crawl: CTR optimization, content decay, striking-distance / page-2 keywords, keyword cannibalization, dead pages, brand vs non-brand health, topical authority clusters (topic cocoons), competitor gaps, and basic on-page checks. It ends with a prioritized action plan wired into Distribb. Works on every plan.

## Backlink Exchange

Distribb connects real businesses that exchange backlinks. When your article includes a link to a network partner, Distribb detects it on submission and credits your project. More given = more received. Every current plan gets unlimited exchange access; legacy Free Agentic accounts receive 1 backlink/month. These are high-DR links from legitimate business websites.

## Bring-Your-Own-Keys (legacy Free Agentic accounts)

The free Agentic plan is deprecated and no longer offered to new users. Accounts still on it do not bundle keyword data, so those users save their own **DataForSEO** or **Ahrefs** API keys at [distribb.io/settings#seo-keys](https://distribb.io/settings#seo-keys). All other endpoints (articles, integrations, backlinks, audit) work normally without any keys.

When `/api/v1/keywords/search` is called from a legacy Free Agentic account with no keys saved, the response is HTTP 402 with `"error": "byo_keys_required"` and an `instructions_for_agent` string. Surface that string to the user verbatim and do not retry until they have saved credentials.

## Microworkers Campaign Management

Distribb can create/register project-scoped Microworkers Basic Campaigns, list worker slots/submissions, and rate submissions as `OK`, `NOK`, or `REVISE`. Campaign creation requires `project_id`, `title`, `description`, and `template_html`; optional fields include `platform`, `campaign_type`, `category_id`, `available_positions`, `payment_per_task`, proof settings, and timing controls.

## Sub-skills

| Folder | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`90-day-seo-sprint/`](./90-day-seo-sprint/) | Run the Distribb 90-Day SEO Sprint: a phased program (Pre-launch / Foundation / Content Engine / Authority) built on the endpoints in this skill. Use when the user asks for an "SEO sprint", "90-day SEO plan", or "where do I start with SEO". |

## Command-line helpers (optional)

The skill works fully with `curl` + `jq` (no install). These Python helpers ship as optional conveniences:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `distribb_cli.py` | A thin CLI over the same API (`projects:list`, `articles:create`, `keywords:search`, `suggestions:list`, `ai-visibility:get`, `ai-visibility:prompts:add`, etc.). `pip install requests python-dotenv`, then `export DISTRIBB_API_KEY=...`. |
| `distribb_research.py` | A standalone original-data research pipeline (plan -> scrape -> analyze) that produces a sourced hook + data table to weave into articles. Uses your own AI key; never invents data. |
| `distribb_writer.py` | A reference implementation showing how to write an SEO article locally with your own AI and submit it via the API. Meant to be modified or swapped out. |
| `news_topics.py` | Used by `/news-writer`. A stdlib-only Google News RSS scraper (no API key, no install) that surfaces fresh, recent headlines for a niche and writes `news_topics_export.csv` next to itself. |

## MCP Server (Cursor / Claude Desktop)

The MCP server exposes every Distribb endpoint as a native tool. See the [API docs](https://distribb.io/api-docs#ep-mcp) for setup.
