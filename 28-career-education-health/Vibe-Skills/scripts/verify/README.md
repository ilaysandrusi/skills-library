This directory stores executable verification gates for local and CI use.

The default release closure is intentionally small. Use it to prove the normal release path. Use touched-surface extension gates only when the change actually touches that family.

`check.ps1` checks installed-copy health and receipt health for a selected `SkillsDir`; it does not replace release verification.

## Start Here

- family map and typical run order: [`gate-family-index.md`](./gate-family-index.md)
- minimum closure proof contract: [`../../config/live-document-contract.json`](../../config/live-document-contract.json)
- broader operator surface: [`../governance/README.md`](../governance/README.md)
- blackbox/probe workflow: use the relevant gate family listed in
  [`gate-family-index.md`](./gate-family-index.md)

## Most Common Commands

Bootstrap readiness:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\vibe-bootstrap-doctor-gate.ps1 -WriteArtifacts
```

Router AI advice connectivity:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\vibe-router-ai-connectivity-gate.ps1 -WriteArtifacts
```

Phase-end cleanup:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\..\governance\phase-end-cleanup.ps1 -WriteArtifacts
```

If packaging / compatibility topology changed:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\..\governance\phase-end-cleanup.ps1 -WriteArtifacts -IncludeMirrorGates
```

## Common Verify Sequence

```powershell
& ".\vibe-governed-runtime-contract-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-canonical-entry-truth-gate.ps1" -SessionRoot <returned session_root> -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-runtime-execution-proof-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-release-truth-consistency-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-repo-cleanliness-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

This default closure path stays intentionally small. Packaging, freshness, and retired-routing audit gates are still available when the change actually touches those surfaces.

If the change touches retired-routing language or route-era cleanup, run `vibe-pack-routing-smoke.ps1` and `vibe-current-routing-debt-gate.ps1`. The retired exact-output router golden gate is no longer part of the verification surface.

## High-Frequency Quick Starts

Routing stability:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-routing-stability-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Current routing debt:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-current-routing-debt-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Repo cleanliness:

```powershell
& ".\..\governance\install-local-worktree-excludes.ps1"
& ".\vibe-repo-cleanliness-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-output-artifact-boundary-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Version / packaging:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-version-consistency-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-version-packaging-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Installed runtime freshness:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-installed-runtime-freshness-gate.ps1" -TargetRoot "<host-root>"
```

## Legacy-Name Notes

- `vibe-version-packaging-gate.ps1` keeps its legacy name, but in the current contract it validates canonical-only packaging governance plus generated-compatibility wiring.
- `vibe-config-parity-gate.ps1` keeps its legacy name, but in canonical-only mode it validates config closure and confirms repo-tracked bundled copies stay absent.
- `vibe-mirror-edit-hygiene-gate.ps1` blocks accidental reintroduction of repo-tracked mirror edits.

## Boundaries

- Run topology-aware and execution-context-locked gates from the canonical repo root only.
- Latest PASS / FAIL truth lives in `outputs/verify/*.json`, not in this README.
- Deep family lists, plane-specific gates, and specialist workflows stay in [`gate-family-index.md`](./gate-family-index.md) and linked topic docs.
- Flat gate filenames remain compatibility contracts; family regrouping must preserve callable entrypoint stability until an explicit replacement contract exists.
