# Interoperability Crosswalk: DDEX, Identifiers, and C2PA

Use this reference only when a package may be exchanged with a registry,
label, distributor, publisher, PRO/CMO, marketplace, or provenance system.

## Boundary

The Suede schema is an intake and evidence model. The mappings below are
orientation aids, not a DDEX implementation profile, certified message, legal
opinion, registry submission, or C2PA Content Credential. Do not say a package
is DDEX- or C2PA-compliant merely because similarly named fields exist.

Before an external exchange:

1. identify the receiver and exact standard/profile/version it accepts;
2. validate identifiers with the responsible issuing or authoritative party;
3. map controlled vocabularies using that receiver's rules;
4. preserve source evidence and unknown/disputed status;
5. validate the exported message or manifest with the receiver's conformance
   tooling; and
6. obtain creator/operator approval before transmission.

## Object and identifier separation

| Suede object | Common identifier | What it identifies | Do not use it for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `works[]` | ISWC | A musical work/composition | A sound recording or release |
| `recordings[]` | ISRC | A specific sound recording or music video recording | The underlying composition |
| `releases[]` | UPC/EAN | A marketed release/product | Ownership or party identity |
| `parties[]` | IPI/CAE | A party in rights-management systems | A work or recording |
| `parties[]` | ISNI | A public identity for a person or organization | Proof of ownership |
| `releases[]` | Catalog number | A label/distributor catalog reference | A globally unique registry ID |

Every identifier is paired with `status` and `evidence_refs`. A plausible
format is not proof that the identifier is valid or belongs to the object.

## DDEX-oriented mapping

| Suede field | DDEX-oriented concept | Export note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `parties[]` | Party | Map roles and identifiers to the selected DDEX allowed-value sets. |
| `works[]` | Musical work | Preserve writers, publishers, ISWC, and evidence separately. |
| `recordings[]` | Resource / sound recording | Preserve ISRC, performers, master controllers, and asset links. |
| `releases[]` | Release | Map recording membership, release identifiers, label, dates, and territories. |
| `rights_claims[]` | Right share / right-delegation facts | Scope each share by object, right type, territory, and dates. Never force unknown shares to total 100. |
| `licenses[]` | Deal or delegated-use facts | Receiver-specific messages may model these differently; retain source agreements as evidence. |
| `third_party_material[]` | Resource/work dependencies and clearances | Samples, interpolations, covers, loops, and beats need explicit source and clearance state. |

The studio-stage metadata concepts in DDEX Recording Information Notification
(RIN) are useful for contributor, role, session, and resource capture. RIN
orientation does not make this package a valid RIN message.

## C2PA-oriented mapping

`provenance.content_credentials[]` can record that a C2PA manifest was found
or checked. It does not create or sign one.

| Suede field | C2PA-oriented concept | Required handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `asset_id` | Asset associated with a manifest | Resolve to a hashed asset in `assets[]`. |
| `kind: c2pa` | Content Credential / manifest reference | Store a reference, not private signing material. |
| `verification_status` | Local verification result | Record `verified_at` and evidence from a named verifier. |
| `manifest_reference` | Manifest or sidecar location | Apply privacy classification before sharing. |
| `evidence_refs` | Verification output | Retain the redacted report or digest used for the claim. |

Hashing an asset proves only that the bytes seen later can be compared with
the bytes inventoried. A SHA-256 digest alone does not establish authorship,
ownership, consent, chronology, or C2PA authenticity.

Primary source: [C2PA specifications](https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/).

## Privacy and synthetic-media consent

- Default packages to `private-draft`.
- Classify contact, wallet/payment, agreement, unreleased-asset, and identity
  fields before external sharing.
- Use `consents[]` for voice, likeness, and AI-use scope. Unknown consent stays
  `unknown`; silence is not consent.
- Never include seed phrases, private keys, account secrets, unredacted IDs,
  or an agreement whose sharing is restricted.
- Export only the minimum fields required by the intended recipient.

## Export gate

An external export is blocked when any required identifier, share, territory,
term, authority, consent, or evidence is disputed or unknown. The package can
still be structurally valid; the blocking condition belongs in
`missing_information[]` and `risk_flags[]`.
