# Marketing Operations Stack — Skills + MCPs per AARRR Stage

This doc maps every marketing-skill and every relevant MCP/API integration to the AARRR stage(s) it primarily serves. It's the source for Section 11 of every plan.

> **Note on scope.** Skills below live in the public Suede skill pack. External
> tools are optional. Discover current callable, authorized capabilities first;
> otherwise use a manual workflow and record the limitation in Section 13.

## The thesis

The public Suede skill pack and verified integrations can make approved workflows more repeatable for a small team. They do not replace channel ownership, human review, or missing expertise, and they do not imply a headcount-equivalence or guaranteed output.

The plan's Section 11 makes this thesis explicit by:
1. Mapping skills to stages so the founder sees which skills execute which work
2. Mapping MCPs/APIs to stages so the founder sees the tooling layer
3. Naming a concrete, evidence-backed operational example that shows how the stack was used
4. Showing capability unlocks by verified evidence, owner capacity,
   authorization, maximum exposure, review date, and stop conditions

## Capability unlocks by verified resource state

Section 11 must include this table (or equivalent). Funding stage may be context,
but it does not supply the answer.

| Capability | Current evidence and owner | Constraint | Unlock condition | Approval / maximum exposure | Review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Acquisition test | | | | | |
| Lifecycle | | | | | |
| Content / creative | | | | | |
| Analytics | | | | | |
| Community / PR | | | | | |

Mark each capability `current`, `approved test`, `conditional unlock`, or
`deferred` using `funding-stage-unlocks.md`. Never infer headcount, tool spend,
or channel scale from a round label.

## The concrete-example test

Section 11 of the plan must include at least one concrete operational example that grounds the stack thesis in evidence. The example should be:
- A specific event (not abstract claim)
- From this client's actual history when a source artifact is available
- Tied to a named owner, workflow, review step, and observable result
- Careful not to attribute an outcome to a skill or integration unless the evidence supports that causal claim

Use this evidence format:
- *"On [date], [owner] used [verified skill/tool] to complete [specific workflow]. [Reviewer] approved [artifact or deployment]. The recorded result was [measured observation], according to [source]."*
- If the result is only an illustrative planning scenario, label every number as an assumption and state that it is not an expected outcome.

If the client has no verified example yet, frame it as the *first test* — "Here is the workflow the team will run in week one, the artifact it will produce, and the metric it will observe." Do not present the test as proof or forecast its result.

## When the stack doesn't apply (yet)

For clients without callable authorized connections, frame Section 11
differently:
- List the manual workflows and public Suede skills that apply now.
- Name the specific evidence or efficiency question an optional connection
  could address, plus owner, data boundary, cost, fallback, and review.
- Keep setup or installation as an unapproved option until the user explicitly
  authorizes the exact tool, account, scope, cost, and mutation boundary. Do not
  assign it to Q1 by default.

A plan can't claim the agentic-stack thesis if the stack isn't wired. Be honest about state.
