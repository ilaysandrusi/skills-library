// ---------------------------------------------------------------- 0. scout
phase('Scout')
const scout = await agent(
  `Repo: ${REPO}. Planned scope: ${SCOPE}

You are the SCOUT. Read-only reconnaissance plus ONE setup action. Do not edit source.

1. This machine is a stale mirror. Run: git -C ${REPO} fetch origin && git -C ${REPO} status --short --branch
2. Record every dirty and untracked file (these are protected WIP — never in a lane scope).
3. Check for live processes holding an existing worktree: lsof -d cwd 2>/dev/null | grep worktrees
   Any hit is a hazard "live-worktree" — do NOT reuse or remove that path.
4. Worktree for this run. FIRST run \`git -C ${REPO} worktree list\` and look for an existing
   worktree whose path contains "/ship-" — if one exists and no live process holds it, REUSE
   it and report its path; do not create a second. Otherwise create one, cut from origin/main
   (never local main):
   git -C ${REPO} worktree add ../$(basename ${REPO}).worktrees/ship-<short-slug> origin/main
   Copy any untracked env files the app needs (.env.local etc) into it.
5. Hazard sweep, report only, no fixes:
   - bare api/ directory: every .js/.ts there is a PUBLIC serverless route. Flag test/fixture/scratch files as "vercel-api-route".
   - vercel.json missing the preview-killing ignoreCommand -> "missing-ignore-command".
   - any secret literal in files you touched -> "secret".

   CRITICAL — \`kind\` is the TOPIC you looked at; \`blocking\` is the verdict. Set
   blocking:true ONLY when the dangerous condition is actually present and would make it
   unsafe to proceed RIGHT NOW. Report all-clears with blocking:false — they are valuable
   and will not stop the run. Specifically:
   - "no secrets found" -> kind:"secret", blocking:FALSE
   - "vercel.json already has the ignoreCommand" -> kind:"missing-ignore-command", blocking:FALSE
   - a live process in ANOTHER repo's worktree -> blocking:FALSE (irrelevant to this run;
     note it so nobody touches it). blocking:true for kind "live-worktree" ONLY if a live
     process holds a worktree of ${REPO} that this run would reuse or remove.
   - a real secret literal committed in a TRACKED file -> blocking:TRUE. A gitignored
     .env file is not a blocking secret; note it blocking:FALSE and warn builders off it.
6. SIBLING CLAIMS — what other branches of this repo already have in flight. Worktrees live
   in TWO families and an audit that globs only the first silently misses ~25% of them:
     ls -d $(dirname ${REPO})/$(basename ${REPO}).worktrees/*/ ${REPO}/.claude/worktrees/*/ 2>/dev/null
   Cross-check against \`git -C ${REPO} worktree list\`. For each sibling (skip THIS run's
   worktree), report:
     - branch: git -C <wt> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
     - files: git -C <wt> diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD  PLUS  git -C <wt> status --porcelain
       (committed-but-unmerged work AND uncommitted work both count as claimed)
     - likelyLanded: run \`git -C <wt> cherry origin/main\`. A leading "-" means an equivalent
       patch is ALREADY upstream, i.e. squash-merged. Ancestry alone lies here: git log will
       show commits ahead and git diff will show changed files even when the content already
       landed, because main moved on. Set likelyLanded:true for those; their file claims are dead.
     - liveProcess: lsof -d cwd 2>/dev/null | grep "<wt path>" — ANY process, not just claude.
       A worktree held by a bare \`gh\` or \`node\` and no claude process at all is still live.
   Paths only. Do not read the siblings' file contents.
7. List at most 60 candidate files the scope plausibly touches, by PATH ONLY.

Return the manifest. Do NOT paste file contents into your answer — builders read their own files.`,

constraint is wrong even if it satisfies the scope — if the scope genuinely requires
breaking one, say so in that lane's acceptance criterion so it surfaces at review
instead of at deploy. Where history shows this was already tried and reverted, do not
repeat the reverted approach without naming why it will work this time.

Hard rules:
- Every file belongs to exactly ONE lane. Overlap is a planning bug, not a runtime problem.
- If two lanes genuinely need the same file, MERGE them into one lane. Do not split a file's ownership.
- No lane may list a protected dirty file.
- Each lane gets an observable acceptance criterion (a command, a route, a rendered state) — never "looks right".
- Tier each lane honestly: mechanical (complete spec, no judgment), integration (multi-file, pattern-match the codebase), judgment (design/security/data-shape calls).
- This run's agent budget allows at most ${BUDGET.maxLanes} lanes. Fewer is better; that number is a ceiling, not a target.
