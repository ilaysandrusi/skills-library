# Suede Visibility Grader

## Gate policy — advisory, not blocking

Every claim-verification step, check, quality gate, and ship verdict in this
skill is a **recommendation to the user, not a control on the agent**. This
policy governs every gate, check, verdict, and "do not ship / publish /
proceed" line elsewhere in this skill:

- Run every check and report the results honestly. Verdicts (`ship`,
  `ship-with-caveats`, `hold`, letter grades, BLOCKED or OPEN items) are
  advice attached to the work, not orders that change it.
- Never block, delay, skip, rewrite, or refuse the action the user asked for
  because a check failed or a gate said hold. Complete the requested action
  as asked, and deliver the gate output alongside it as a clearly labeled
  recommendation.
- A failed gate changes what you report, never what you do.
- Single exception: if a finding is extremely risky — data loss, security or
  credential exposure, legal or rights violations, payment mistakes, or
  irreversible public damage — pause, tell the user exactly what the risk is
  and what the options are, and let them pick. Their choice is final.


Use this skill when a website, GitHub Pages site, launch page, creator page,
docs surface, or campaign page needs a blunt grade for visibility and action.
The goal is not generic SEO advice. The goal is to answer one question:

```text
Can the right person or agent find this page, understand it, trust it, cite it,
and take the intended next action?
```

**Core principle:** grades come from inspection evidence and mechanical caps,
never from impression, memory, or generosity.

## Routing

Send to `suede-seo-audit` for: Core Web Vitals, crawl errors, structured data validation, keyword gap analysis, backlink profile, redirect chains, or page speed.

Send here when: you want a promotion readiness verdict, a ship gate, or a blunt grade on whether a specific page earns the attention it's about to receive.

After grading: fixes are conversion-shaped (CTA, friction, offer) → `suede-site-alchemy`. Grade passed and the page ships as part of a release → `suede-launch-packaging`.

## Source Truth

Inspect before grading. Do not grade from memory or description alone.

- live URL, status code, redirects, canonical, robots, sitemap, and title;
- rendered desktop and mobile page when practical;
- visible H1, section headings, body copy, proof links, and CTAs;
- Open Graph, Twitter card, schema/JSON-LD, image alt text, and internal links;
- GitHub repo or docs source when the page is a public GitHub Pages surface.

Do not grade from memory alone. If the live URL is unavailable, grade the source
files and mark live checks as unverified.

## Grade Lanes

Score each lane A-F, then give one overall grade:

- **Findability:** status, canonical, robots, sitemap, title, description,
  durable keywords, and duplicate URL risk.
- **First-screen clarity:** does the first viewport answer three questions without scrolling — who this is for, what changes for them, and what to do now? Grade on the rendered first viewport, not the document structure.
- **CTA pull:** primary action, secondary proof action, button text, link
  targets, and whether the visitor has a reason to click now.
- **Proof and trust:** screenshots, commands, docs, manifests, live routes,
  source files, receipts, authorship, and evidence boundaries.
- **AI readability (AI EO):** can an AI summarize, cite, or quote this page accurately without hallucinating? Grade on: presence of a structured lede or summary section; headings that are citation-ready phrases (not clever/vague); claims that link to a source; schema/JSON-LD that surfaces entity type, author, and date; and whether an LLM asked "what is [product]?" would return a correct, attributable answer from this page.

  AI readability sub-rubric (each item is worth one grade step):
  - Structured lede: first 100 words answer "what is this, who is it for, what does it do" without jargon.
  - Citation-ready headings: headings read as answer fragments an LLM would quote directly. "Getting started" = F. "How to install X in 3 commands" = A.
  - Sourceable claims: every quantitative or comparative claim links to a source or shows primary evidence.
  - Entity schema: JSON-LD or OpenGraph declares entity type, author/organization, and published date.
  - Internal link density: at least one link to a more-detailed resource per major section.
  - AI test: if an LLM were asked "what is [product/page topic]?" right now, would this page produce a correct, non-hallucinated answer? If no, cap AI readability at C.
- **Design signal:** grades on seven axes — each is pass/fail, grade is the worst three:
  1. Hierarchy: H1 > H2 > body weight is visually obvious at a glance.
  2. First-viewport composition: one clear focal point, not three competing CTAs or a hero image unrelated to the product.
  3. Spacing rhythm: consistent padding/margin system. No collapsed margins or random gutters.
  4. Typography: one or two font families. Body copy readable at 16px equivalent. Line length under 80ch.
  5. Asset quality: images are sharp, not stretched, not stock-obvious, not AI-slop.
  6. Contrast: primary CTA passes WCAG AA. Body text passes WCAG AA.
  7. AI-slop pattern risk: the page does not read as generated filler (vague value props, stock faces, generic icons, paragraph-length sentences with no specificity). If two or more slop signals are present, cap Design signal at C.

Grade meaning — assign on evidence, not impression:

- **A:** every lane is strong (no lane below B). Ship. Post this as a reference for the next build.
- **B:** one or two lanes at C; none below C. Fix those; everything else is solid.
- **C:** three or more lanes at C, or any lane at D. The page works but bleeds attention or trust somewhere in the first scroll. Not ready for paid promotion.
- **D:** two or more lanes at D, or any lane at F short of the overall-F conditions. Visible but embarrassing under scrutiny. A focused rewrite of one surface fixes it.
- **F:** assign when any of these are true: primary CTA is broken, a published statement is false, the page doesn't render, or robots/canonical actively blocks it.

Grade caps — non-negotiable:

- No live inspection → Overall cap: `C`.
- Broken primary CTA → Overall cap: `D`.
- False or unsupported published statement → Overall cap: `D`. (If the statement is central to the product promise, `F`.)
- Design signal `D` or `F` → Recommended ship gate is **hold**, regardless of other lanes.
- Mobile not inspected → `A` is blocked. State the caveat explicitly in Verification.

Recommended ship gate — mechanical (a recommendation to the user, not a lock on any action):

- **ship:** Overall B or better, no grade cap triggered, no lane below C.
- **ship-with-caveats:** Overall C, or a higher grade blocked only by uninspected surfaces (mobile, live URL). Name every caveat in Verification.
- **hold:** Overall D or F, broken primary CTA, false published statement, or Design signal at D or F.

## Surface-Type Standards

Per-surface standards — landing page, docs, repo page, launch page, campaign page —
are in `references/surface-type-standards.md`. Read the section for the surface you
are grading; the lanes above apply to every surface.

## Grade Modes

**Quick grade** — triggered when asked for a fast read, first impression, or "gut check":
- Grade the first viewport only (rendered desktop).
- Score all six lanes based on what is visible without scrolling.
- Output: one paragraph + lane grades + ship gate. No top fixes list.
- Cap: Quick grades cannot assign A. Max is B.

**Deep grade** (default):
- Full inspection: live URL + source, desktop + mobile, all viewport states available.
- All six lanes, full top-fixes list, CTA rewrite in the P1 fix description if CTA pull is C or below.
- Ship gate is authoritative.

## Red Flags — Stop

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, stop and inspect:

- "The repo description tells me enough to grade." — Inspect the live page or source. No inspection caps Overall at C.
- "Desktop looks fine; mobile will match." — Mobile not inspected blocks A. Check it or state the caveat.
- "That statement is probably true." — Unverified published statements cap the grade. Verify or flag them.
- "Every other lane is strong; I'll round up." — Grades come from lane evidence and caps, not generosity.
- "A quick look is enough for a deep grade." — Quick mode exists for that, and it caps at B.
