# Local SMB Prospecting Reference

For when the user sells to local small businesses — shops, gyms, restaurants, salons, clinics, professional services, contractors, real estate, fitness studios, dental practices.

Adapted from and generalized beyond the local-client-prospector pattern (browser-assisted discovery + website status classification + proximity scoring).

## ICP Signals That Matter (Local SMB branch)

### Operational signals

- **Active business** — Google Business Profile updated, recent reviews, recent hours updates
- **Recent activity** — open right now, regular hours posted, recent photos uploaded by owner
- **Customer engagement** — owner responding to reviews, posts on social, active calendar (for service businesses)

### Online presence signals (the core SMB qualification axis)

The reference local-client-prospector skill uses **website status** as the primary qualification — port this directly. Four classifications:

| Status | Definition | Typical outcome |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **No site found** | No credible standalone website after cross-checked search | **Hot prospect** for web/marketing service |
| **Social only** | Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Linktree, booking portal, marketplace page only — no standalone site | **Hot prospect** for web/marketing service |
| **Weak site** | Standalone site exists but outdated, broken, very thin, non-mobile-friendly, or missing clear contact/conversion flow | **Warm prospect** for refresh / rebuild service |
| **Has site** | Credible, modern standalone site exists | **Low prospect** unless other signals apply (e.g., poor SEO, weak conversion design) |

### Proximity signals

- **Distance** from the user's location or service area
- **Density** — clusters of similar businesses in one area = neighborhood targeting opportunity
- **Travel time** — useful when in-person discovery, install, or service delivery is required

### Decay signals

- Closed permanently (Google Maps banner)
- Reviews paused or business listing reported as closed
- Last activity (review, post) >12 months ago

## Discovery Sources (Local SMB branch)

### Primary

- **Google Maps** (browser, manual) — search "category near [location]" and walk the visible results. Cross-check details. Don't bulk-extract.
- **Yelp** — secondary verification; complementary categories
- **Bing Local / Apple Maps** — different coverage on smaller businesses
- **Facebook Pages search** — many SMBs are Facebook-only

### Cross-verification

- **Business's own website** (if any)
- **Industry directories** (e.g., Healthgrades for medical, OpenTable for restaurants, Avvo for legal)
- **Local Chamber of Commerce listings**
- **State business registries** for incorporation status
- **Search results for "[business name] [city]"** to discover non-Maps presence

## Authorized or Manual Research Workflow

1. Discover whether a research connector or browser is currently callable,
   authenticated where needed, authorized, and permitted by source terms.
2. If available, review a bounded visible result set without bulk extraction.
3. If unavailable, give the user exact public-source queries and work from the
   URLs, exports, screenshots, or copied source text they provide.
4. Cross-check the exact business name plus city/town against the business's own
   site or another current source.
5. Classify website status per the table above and state what remains uncertain.
6. Mark confidence from cited evidence, not from repeated searches of the same
   source.

When the user explicitly asks for subagents AND subagents are available, split candidates into non-overlapping batches and ask each subagent to verify only website/social/contact status. Don't use subagents for the primary search if it slows progress.

### Optional: authorized site verification

After manual discovery, first check whether an authorized browser or
single-site reader is currently callable and permitted for the candidate's own
public website. Possible tools, only when discovered and authorized:

- **Firecrawl** for a bounded text or structured read.
- **Browserbase** or another authorized browser for JavaScript rendering,
  consent dialogs, or session state.

If neither is available, open the public site manually or ask the user for the
URL, screenshots, and visible business contact details.

**Strict line**: use these on the individual business's URL. **Don't** point them at Google Maps, Yelp, or any platform whose ToS prohibits bulk extraction — discovery stays manual.

See [data-sources.md](data-sources.md) for selection and verification details.

## Qualification Checklist (Local SMB branch)

- [ ] Business is active (recent reviews or activity in last 6 months)
- [ ] Category matches user's service offering
- [ ] Distance / proximity within target radius
- [ ] Website status classified
- [ ] Phone or contact channel verified
- [ ] At least one cross-source confirms business operates at the listed address
- [ ] Not a duplicate / chain location / out-of-scope category
- [ ] Not closed permanently

## Lead Scoring (Local SMB)

Use this simple rubric (matches local-client-prospector pattern):

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Hot** | Verified service gap + active business + approved contact path + location fit |
| **Warm** | Plausible service gap or timing signal, with a material item still to verify |
| **Cold** | ICP fit but no current service-gap or timing evidence |
| **Skip** | Closed, duplicate, outside radius, irrelevant category, or not a business prospect |

---

## Output Columns (Local SMB branch)

Chat table (≤15 rows):

```
| Score | Business | Category | Area | Distance | Website status | Website/Social | Phone | Why it's a prospect | Confidence |
```

CSV:

```csv
score,business,category,area,distance_km,website_status,website_url,social_urls,phone,email,source_urls,why_prospect,confidence,verified_date,notes
```

Rules:
- Keep "Why it's a prospect" short and actionable
- Use `Not found` instead of leaving blank fields
- Include source links sparingly, not all of them
- After the table, add a bounded **Priority review candidates** section only
  when current evidence supports it
- If confidence is low, state exactly what remains uncertain

---

## Priority Review Selection (Local SMB)

Prioritize a bounded review set when the evidence supports it:

1. **No site / social only + phone present** = clearest service opportunity
2. **High review count** = active, established business with real customers
3. **Owner-responded reviews** = engaged owner = more likely to evaluate a vendor
4. **Industry alignment with your service specialty** is stronger evidence than
   a generic category match when both are current and cited

Each top target rationale should be one sentence naming the gap and the signal: "No standalone website (cross-checked); 80+ Google reviews with owner replies; 2 km from target area."

## Compliance Notes (Local SMB-specific)

The local branch is the most scraping-sensitive of the three motions. Specifically:

- **Google Maps Terms of Service** prohibit bulk extraction. Treat browser visits as research, not as data acquisition.
- **Don't store full Google Maps Place IDs in your CRM** — the ToS limits storage of Maps data.
- **Public business contact channels only**: published phone, contact form, info@ email. Don't reach individual employees through their personal channels.
- **Owner/operator name when published on the business's own site** is OK to use. If you only got it from LinkedIn, mark the source.

## Common Mistakes (Local SMB)

1. **Bulk-scraping Google Maps** — fastest way to violate ToS and lose the research channel.
2. **Treating Google Maps data as truth** — listings go stale. Cross-check hours, status, and reviews.
3. **Skipping the website status cross-check** — finding "no site" on Maps doesn't mean no site exists; do an exact-name web search before classifying.
4. **Assuming size predicts need** — verify the current service gap and buying
   context instead of treating any employee band as universally underserved.
5. **Generic outreach drafts** — cite the verified gap and keep every send as a
   separate approved action.
6. **Ignoring chains and franchises** as Skip — sometimes the franchisee is the buyer and they have local marketing authority. Verify before skipping.
