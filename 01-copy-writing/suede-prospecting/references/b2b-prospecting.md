## ICP Signals That Matter (B2B branch)

### Firmographic signals

- **Industry / vertical** — NAICS or SIC codes if precision matters
- **Company size** — headcount band, revenue band, location count
- **Geography** — relevant for time zones, regulations, on-site requirements
- **Business model** — service vs product vs distribution; B2B vs B2B2C
- **Ownership** — independent, PE-backed, public, family-owned — affects buying motion

### Buying signals

- **Trigger events**: new C-level hire, recent acquisition or divestiture, IPO/funding, opening a new location, recent rebrand, expansion announcement
- **Vendor signals**: posting RFPs publicly, switching costs in last quarterly report, contract renewal windows
- **Operational signals**: recent layoffs (cost pressure) or rapid hiring (capacity pressure)
- **News mentions**: launching new initiative, entering new market, regulatory change forcing action
- **PR / press**: anything that signals "this company is changing right now"

### Decay signals

- Multiple bankruptcies or PE-stripped operations
- Negative growth + cost-cutting headlines
- Ownership stagnation (small family-owned, no growth incentive)
- Buyer turnover (3+ Marketing Directors in 2 years)

## Discovery Sources (B2B branch)

### Tier 1 — primary discovery

- **Apollo**: candidate for general B2B firmographic and contact discovery;
  verify current coverage on the target segment
- **ZoomInfo**: enterprise B2B + intent signals (mid-market+)
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: candidate for manual industry, role, and signal
  research; verify current coverage and terms
- **Clay**: when you need custom waterfall lookups (e.g., enrich Apollo records with Hunter + Clearbit)

### Tier 2 — industry-specific directories

- **Crunchbase / Pitchbook**: funded businesses
- **D&B Hoovers**: large traditional B2B firmographics
- **State / national business registries**: for verified incorporation data
- **Industry association membership rosters**: trade groups often publish member lists
- **Trade show exhibitor lists**: signals active participation in a vertical
- **Procurement databases** (Procore for construction, e.g.): vertical-specific signals

### Tier 3 — trigger event monitoring

- **Google Alerts / Feedly**: trigger keywords ("acquired," "hires," "expansion," "raises," "announces")
- **PR Newswire / Business Wire**: company-controlled announcements
- **SEC filings** (public companies): material change disclosures
- **State filings**: new entity formation, dissolution

## Top Outreach Targets Selection (B2B)

Prioritize a bounded review set when the evidence supports it:

1. **Trigger event recency** — compare current and older events without imposing
   a universal expiry window
2. **Trigger specificity** — prefer a cited event tied to the buyer's problem
   over general company news
3. **Decision-maker evidence** — distinguish a confirmed professional contact
   from a role-only inference
4. **Vertical fit precision** — use the taxonomy the current ICP and source data
   can support

Each top target rationale names the trigger and decision-maker: "Hired new VP of Marketing 14 days ago; verified email; mid-market manufacturer matching ICP."

## Common Mistakes (B2B)

1. **Treating B2B like SaaS** — funding rounds matter less; PE ownership and acquisition activity matter more.
2. **Trying to verify private company revenue precisely** — most public databases approximate. Use size bands, not point estimates.
3. **Ignoring procurement complexity** at enterprise scale — your prospect contact list may not include the actual approver.
4. **Cold-emailing executive assistants** — they're not the buyer and they will flag your outreach as spam.
5. **Source URL hygiene** — without source lineage, you can't defend a contact under GDPR DSAR or CAN-SPAM challenge.
6. **Stopping at one source** — provider accuracy varies by segment and date.
   Cross-verify important claims with a current first-party or independent
   source.
