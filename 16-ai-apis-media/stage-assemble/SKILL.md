description: Deterministically assemble an approved cross-modal EDL (plan.json) into a finished video — produce each segment (edit/compose/generate/provided, delegated to its line), then assemble in ffmpeg tiers: concat primaries → overlay composed layers → mix narration once (coverage check) → burn captions → verify loudness; idempotent-resumable, with QA before the draft gate. Trigger after a plan is validated and approved; do NOT trigger to ingest or re-author the plan (stage-plan).

# stage-assemble

How to execute a validated `project/plan.json` into one finished file. By the time you are here the plan passed `ovs plan validate` and the user approved it at gate B. Walk it; do not re-plan. The producers are `ovs edit`, `ovs draft`, `ovs video`/`ovs image`, `ovs speak`, and the assembler is `ovs edit` (or the equivalent MCP tools).

## Step 1 — Produce each segment (delegate by source)

Iterate segments in `order`. For each, produce its `produced_path` according to `source`, then write that path + `status:"done"` back into the segment so a resume never re-produces it:

- **edit** → `stage-edit`: `ovs edit trim` the `input_id` to `[in_sec, out_sec]` → `project/cuts/<id>.mp4`.
- **compose** → `stage-compose`: build a small visual-only manifest-owned composition for `spec.kind` (title card, lower-third, stat card, captions) under `project/compositions/<id>/` → run `ovs draft project/compositions/<id> --out project/parts/<id>.mp4 --quality draft --report project/reports/<id>-compose-report.json`. This keeps compose segments on the same manifest/source/check/video-QA path as standalone COMPOSE while still letting the assembler own narration and loudness.
- **generate** → `stage-generate` (+ `stage-consistency` for recurring characters): only AFTER gate C. `ovs video`/`ovs image` → `project/assets/<id>.mp4`. For `operation:"edit"`, pass the exact original reference video and obey top-level `references` plus `edit_strategy`; never widen it into regeneration. A failed/unknown paid attempt is not an automatic retry. Preserve completed siblings and require a new output path for any later authorized attempt.
- **provided** → use `spec.asset_id` as-is (probe it first; conform aspect/fps if needed).

Billable `generate` segments must not run before gate C has confirmed the count from `cost_estimate`. Produce cheap/free segments (edit, compose, provided) freely.

## Step 2 — Assemble in ffmpeg tiers (the default path)

Assemble deterministically, bottom-up. This tiered order is the default; it is predictable and cheap, and keeps each clip's real audio intact:

1. **Primary track** — `ovs edit concat` the primary-layer `produced_path`s in `order` → `project/render/primary.mp4`. Conform aspect/fps on the way in if sources differ.
2. **Overlays / bg** — for each overlay/bg segment, `ovs edit overlay` its part onto the primary over the window of the segment named in `over` (title cards, lower-thirds, logos). Composed layers are VISUAL-ONLY — they must not carry their own narration audio. **This includes a compose segment that IS the primary track (a full-video composition): render it SILENT — do not put a narration `<audio>` in its `index.html`. The assembler owns narration (tier 3), so a composition that bakes it in would mean narration is added TWICE (the "two voices" defect).**
3. **Narration — added EXACTLY ONCE, here.** If active, require the Gate-B-signed `tracks.narration.synthesis` profile. Run `ovs narration fit` for each timed line before `ovs speak`; shorten over-budget text in the plan without changing the approved meaning. Synthesize with the exact signed voice/model/format/speed, probe the result, rerun measured fit, and write each line's `produced_path`. If measured timing misses, revise once using the suggested unit budget rather than repeatedly billing or forcing speed. Add all produced lines in ONE `ovs edit mix` call at their `start_sec`. The default existing-audio rejection catches compose segments that accidentally baked narration; re-render those SILENT. Check coverage, and disclose any intentional silent tail at Gate D. Preserve a generated talking head's built-in lip-synced audio instead of adding a second voice.
4. **Music** — add `tracks.music` ducked under narration by the planned amount.
5. **Captions** — turn `tracks.captions.lines` (`{text, start_sec, target_sec}`) into a `.srt`, then `ovs edit burnsubs`. Captions are DATA in the plan — burned ONLY here at assemble — so a later typo fix is a one-line edit re-burned, never a re-render of the picture. If `burnsubs` fails because the runtime ffmpeg lacks subtitle filter support, stop and report that blocker; do not hand-write a fallback ffmpeg graph, PNG subtitle overlay, or drawtext pipeline.
6. **Loudness** — run `ovs edit normalize-loudness project/render/draft.mp4 --out project/render/video.mp4`. It normalizes to the `video-craft` §7 targets (~−14 LUFS integrated, true-peak ≤ ~−1 dBTP) and returns measured loudness; use `ovs edit loudness` only for diagnosis without writing an output.

Apply the plan's `style_kit` for cohesion: composed layers (titles/captions/cards) use its `palette` + `fonts`. A single `lut` graded across all clips is what unifies tonally mixed sources — until a grade op is available, keep mixed sources close at capture/trim and lean on the shared palette + consistent captions for cohesion rather than promising a uniform grade.

Output `project/render/video.mp4` as the deliverable; `project/render/draft.mp4` is the pre-normalized intermediate.

## Director judgment (end-to-end assembly)

The craft of making mixed sources feel like one video, on top of the shared craft (`video-craft`). The seams between footage / generated / composed are where multi-source assembly falls apart — engineer continuity across them:

- **One look across every source.** Apply the `style_kit` so a cut from real footage → a generated shot → a composed card does not read as three videos: one type system + palette on every composed layer, one caption style throughout, matched aspect / fps, tonal proximity (a shared LUT is the unifier when available; `video-craft` §4).
- **Audio is the through-line that hides the visual seam.** One narration voice; a continuous music bed UNDER the cuts (do not restart it per segment); duck consistently (`video-craft` §7). The ear's continuity carries the eye across a source change — a reveal may drop music, but the bed bridges the cut.
- **Rhythm over a mixed cut.** Alternate motion vs. static and source types for momentum — do not stack three composed cards or three talking-head shots in a row (that is the repetition / slideshow smell, `video-craft` §3, §12). Vary holds.
- **Cut on a content change, not just plan order.** A hard cut on a beat / word change is invisible and professional; a crossfade signals a gentle topic shift (`video-craft` §5).
- **Don't bury the hero.** On a `source_led` piece, composed lower-thirds and captions FRAME the footage — they never cover its subject / face (`video-craft` §6).
- **Apply the editing cut craft ACROSS the seams.** The cut mechanics live in `stage-edit` → "Cut craft" (best sub-window, ≤ 4 transitions, L/J-cut sound bridges, handles / no freeze-frame, adjacent-diversity, a reason per cut) — apply them at every junction between sources, since the footage → generated → composed seams are exactly where a mixed cut betrays itself.

## Step 3 — Idempotent resume

The plan is the checkpoint. On a re-run, skip any segment already `status:"done"` with a present `produced_path`, and skip assembly tiers whose output already exists and is newer than its inputs. Never re-run a billable `generate` segment that is already produced.

For a partial child failure or later revision, reset only the affected child and assembly tiers derived from it. Preserve every unaffected completed child and its evidence. When the child becomes valid, rebuild the complete parent draft and run parent QA in the same workflow; do not stop at a child-only recovery artifact.

## Step 4 — QA report, then gate D

Before showing the draft, run the QA pass and write `project/render_report.json` with these sections:

- **technical_probe** — `ovs edit probe` the draft/final (real duration / resolution / fps / audio present); confirm it matches the plan's aspect + total.
- **promise_preservation** — `ovs plan promise-check project/plan.json --probe-produced`. At gate D this probes each primary segment's `produced_path` and computes the REAL primary-track motion ratio vs. `motion_min_ratio` plus the `source_required` invariant; missing/unreadable produced media or a fail means **"slideshow / promise broken" — do not deliver**. Send it back (below). Do not eyeball this; let the numbers decide.
- **visual_spotcheck** — extract ~4 frames across the draft (`ovs edit extract-frame`) and read them for upside-down / garbled-caption / empty / wrong-product frames. Read them yourself if you are multimodal; if you cannot see images, record the spot-check as `unverified` and proceed — do not invent what the frames show.
- **audio_spotcheck** — the `normalize-loudness` measured loudness numbers + the narration coverage result from step 2 (uncovered tail / overshoot / silent lead-in).
- **transcript_comparison** (when there is narration) — optionally `ovs transcribe` the draft and confirm the spoken words match the planned narration lines.

Each section carries `pass` / `warn` / `fail` + a one-line reason. Then present the draft + headline findings at **Gate D** and resolve the user's decision through `ovs gate transition`.

On approve → finalize `project/render/video.mp4` (loudness / captions only; never re-synthesize a talking-head voice). On revise → redo only the affected segment(s) and re-assemble.

## Send-back (self-correction on a QA fail)

A QA `fail` does not go to the user as "here's a broken video". Diagnose which segment(s) caused it and redo ONLY those, then re-assemble and re-run QA:

- promise_preservation fail (slideshow) → the static composed segments are too long / the motion segments too short. Rebalance segment durations or convert a static beat to footage, re-assemble.
- visual_spotcheck fail (bad frame) → re-produce that one segment (re-trim / re-compose / re-generate), not the whole video.
- audio fail (uncovered tail) → re-time or extend the narration / trim the tail.

Bound repetition, not recovery: allow at most **2** send-back rounds for the same failing check and unchanged strategy. Then preserve evidence and choose a materially different localized repair. Create no technical confirmation. Only a required signed-plan change or new billable attempt returns through its normal authorization boundary.

## Rules

- Walk the approved plan; if assembly reveals the plan is wrong, surface it and re-gate — do not silently re-plan.
- Write `produced_path` + `status` back per segment as you go (resumability + the QA pass depend on it).
- One output file is the deliverable; `cuts/` and `parts/` are intermediates.
- **Narration is added exactly ONCE — in the mix tier, never baked into a compose render.** Compose segments (including a full-video composition used as the primary track) render SILENT (no narration `<audio>`); the assembler mixes narration via `ovs edit mix` with `segments` placed per line. The mix's default `--on-existing-audio reject` enforces this — a "base already has audio" mix rejection is the signal a segment wrongly baked audio in; re-render it silent, then re-mix.
- **No ad-hoc ffmpeg fallbacks for captions.** Caption burn-in is a low-freedom operation owned by `ovs edit burnsubs`; a failed burnsubs call is a tool/runtime blocker, not permission to invent a custom subtitles/drawtext/PNG-overlay command.

## Boundary / non-goals

This skill assembles an already-approved plan. It does not ingest or decide the plan (`stage-plan`), and it delegates the actual production of each segment to the compose / generate / edit / consistency skills rather than re-deriving their craft here.
