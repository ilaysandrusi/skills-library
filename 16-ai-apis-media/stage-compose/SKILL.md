# stage-compose

How to author an Orkas/OVS HTML composition and turn it into a video. `composition-manifest.json` v2 is the canonical timeline/audio/design artifact. In this open-source build, `ovs draft` is the VideoStudio-style production gate: it runs manifest/source/narration/local-asset checks, HyperFrames check/render, media QA, sampled-frame video QA, and writes one report. HyperFrames remains the render backend; do not bypass the draft gate for user-facing drafts.

For visual direction, apply `frontend-design` before writing manifest `art_direction`. If the user provides a reference image/video, DESIGN.md, brand guide, screenshot, design notes, existing app UI, or named style, apply `design-system-importer` to convert it into intent-bound reference constraints and compact tokens. `composition-design-review` is a bounded full-frame review before a visual preview is shown, with a post-draft fallback when preview is skipped.

Gate authorization belongs to `gate-control`. This skill supplies the script, shotlist, design contract, contact sheet, draft, and QA evidence; after any Gate B/Preview/Gate D decision or resumed approval, run `ovs gate transition` rather than inventing a second confirmation or recovery loop.

When the production runtime is unavailable, return a clearly unexecuted candidate package instead of fabricating a render: locked assumptions, final-form script/narration, timed storyboard, exact visible copy/captions, visual/audio and rights-safe asset plan, target export settings, and checkable preview/final QA.

## Fast COMPOSE Runbook

After Gate B approves the script/storyboard, keep the production turn narrow:

1. Read only the approved `project/script.md`, `project/shotlist.json`, and this skill if not already loaded for the current turn. Also read `frontend-design`; read `design-system-importer` only when a concrete style source or explicit named reference exists. Read `composition-design-review` after snapshot evidence exists, or after the draft when preview was intentionally skipped and the fallback trigger applies.
2. If standalone narration is needed, capture the exact `ovs speech-capabilities` profile in the approved plan and run `ovs narration fit` before synthesis. Visual authoring, `ovs check`, and `ovs snapshot` may proceed while narration is pending so the visual candidate remains reviewable. Required narration blocks only complete `ovs draft`/final delivery. Before drafting, run `ovs speak` once to `project/composition/assets/narration.mp3`, declare the composition-owned track, probe its duration, rerun measured fit, and reconcile. Reuse an existing matching narration file; do not synthesize again just because a visual preview changed. For an AUTO segment, use `audio.owner: "assembler"` and render silent.
3. Write `project/composition/composition-manifest.json` with `schema_version: 2`, including approved timeline/copy/source mappings, audio ownership, and `art_direction`. Confirm its dedicated `cover`, any `references`/`reference_fidelity`, and `VisualDirectionV1`; then prepare and author static resolved/hero frames before deterministic motion. The exact 0s cover must already be readable. Reconcile after manifest timing/audio changes without replacing authored DOM/CSS/SVG/motion.
4. Decide whether to open the optional HTML Preview Gate before rendering mp4. Use the preview gate when expected render rework is expensive: target duration >= 45s, scene count >= 7, render cost is likely slow, or the composition has dense text, complex SVG/GSAP, many branded/supplied assets, tight narration timing, or a prior draft failure. Skip it for short/simple work: target duration < 20s, scene count <= 4, no narration/timing complexity, and no obvious visual-risk signal. The subject category alone never forces the preview gate.
5. If visual preview is needed, run `ovs check` and `ovs snapshot`. Review every immutable full-size frame; score cover communication and concrete reference fidelity where declared. Collect all blockers, apply one localized repair, then rerun check/snapshot and review the complete new revision. The contact sheet is only an index. Only a scored passing review may be shown as the visual preview.
6. Run the draft command: `ovs draft project/composition --out project/render/draft.mp4 --quality draft --report project/render/draft-report.json --findings project/composition/qa/check.json`. Before rendering, this gate validates manifest/HTML consistency, prepares declared local vendor assets, blocks remote runtime resources, verifies local assets, checks shotlist/source alignment, and checks narration mapping. Then it runs HyperFrames check/render, media QA, sampled-frame QA, and writes one report.
7. If draft fails, repair the highest canonical source, reconcile when needed, and retry only after the authored signature changes. Do not delete QA state or repeat an unchanged strategy. After two non-converging passes, preserve evidence and choose a materially different localized repair; this is technical recovery, not a user gate.
8. If the draft command returns `ok: true`, the composition is frozen for final-video confirmation. Do not edit `index.html`, `composition-manifest.json`, assets, or narration again in the same turn unless the report contains a real blocker (check/source/audio/video QA failure), or the user explicitly asks for a revision. Visual/readability warnings and design-review `fix`/`polish` notes are advisories, not permission to self-repair.
9. If preview was skipped and the fallback trigger applies, run `composition-design-review` against representative draft frames. Open final-video confirmation only after the draft command returns `ok: true` and any triggered review has no concrete blockers.

The default path is **model-authored HTML -> draft**. Do not write or compile `spec.json`; fixed template compilation is not part of the COMPOSE path because visual quality and extensibility come first.

## HTML Preview Gate

Use the HTML Preview Gate to avoid expensive mp4 rerenders when visual rework is likely. It is a cost-control gate, not a new creative milestone, and it is only for the COMPOSE line. Decide from expected rework cost:

- **Preview first** when duration >= 45s or scene count >= 7.
- **Preview first** when a 20-45s piece has dense text, multiple chapters, many supplied/brand assets, complex SVG/GSAP motion, tight narration timing, or a prior draft/repair failure.
- **Skip preview** when duration < 20s, scene count <= 4, and the HTML is simple enough that rendering the draft is cheaper than asking for another confirmation.
- Do not use product/promo/version-update labels alone as the trigger. Those labels only contribute to risk when the piece is long, visually dense, or expensive to rerender.

When preview is triggered, run `ovs check` and `ovs snapshot`, inspect every immutable `frame_paths` entry with `composition-design-review`, and show only a fully reviewed revision. The contact sheet is an index, not the review evidence. Show the full frame evidence, the `index.html` path, and a compact status line:

- reason for preview: duration / scene count / complexity / prior failure
- check headline: blocking count or main advisory
- what approval means: render mp4 draft next

If the user revises, edit the manifest or HTML, reconcile when needed, then rerun check/snapshot and the complete frame review. Keep this loop lightweight; reuse materialized narration and do not render mp4 during visual preview.

The HTML Preview Gate does not replace the mp4 draft. It cannot validate audio muxing, final encoded video quality, sampled-frame video QA, or exact narration pacing. After approval, always run `ovs draft` and open Gate D with the video.

## Canonical Composition Manifest

Write one `composition-manifest.json` v2 before HTML. It is the source of truth for canvas, duration, scenes, source alignment, audio ownership, and art direction; do not maintain parallel `design-contract.json` and `scene-map.json` files for new work.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "composition": { "id": "main", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "duration": 10, "target_duration": 10, "fps": 30, "language": "en" },
  "audio": { "owner": "none", "tracks": [] },
  "source_alignment": { "merge_reason": "optional when combining approved shotlist beats" },
  "scenes": [
    {
      "id": "hook",
      "start": 0,
      "duration": 10,
      "approved_copy": ["Orkas VideoStudio"],
      "narration_refs": [],
      "source_shots": ["s01"],
      "roles": ["hook"]
    }
  ],
  "art_direction": {
    "aesthetic": { "tone": "precise and cinematic", "signature_device": "timeline ribbon" },
    "cover": { "scene_id": "hook", "headline": "Orkas VideoStudio", "content_signals": ["timeline", "video frame"], "hero_visual": "timeline ribbon", "composition_strategy": "hero ribbon with visible frame payoff", "frame_time_sec": 0 },
    "visual_direction": {},
    "typography_tokens": {},
    "color_tokens": {},
    "motion_budget": {},
    "scene_variation": {},
    "scenes": [{ "id": "hook", "hero_visual": "timeline ribbon", "depth_layers": ["grid", "ribbon", "labels"], "motion_verbs": ["reveal", "track"] }]
  }
}
```

If an approved beat is intentionally merged, add `source_alignment.merge_reason` or per-scene `source_shots`. Standalone narrated schema v2 manifests also require the exact Gate B-signed `audio.narration_intent` and a composition-owned narration track. AUTO child compositions use `audio.owner: "assembler"` and no tracks.

A scene `source_shots` entry may be an approved `shot.id` or a source alias uniquely owned by one shot through `shot.source_shots`; QA canonicalizes those representations. Unknown or multiply-owned aliases are real mapping errors.

## Composition Contract (The Minimum That Renders)

A composition is a directory with `composition-manifest.json` plus `index.html`. Run `ovs composition prepare` to establish the initial contract, and `ovs composition reconcile` after manifest timing/audio changes.

- The **root** element declares the timeline: `data-composition-id="main"`, `data-start="0"`, `data-duration` (seconds), `data-width`, `data-height` (px), and `data-fps`.
- Each visible timed **clip** is a direct child with `class="clip"`, `data-scene-id`, `data-start`, `data-duration`, and `data-track-index` (higher index = drawn on top).
- A paused **GSAP timeline** registered on `window.__timelines["main"]` drives all animation; the renderer seeks it frame by frame. Never use real-time animation (`setInterval`, CSS `animation`) -- only timeline-driven motion renders deterministically.

Canonical minimal `index.html` (16:9, 10s):

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=1920, height=1080" />
    <script src="./assets/vendor/gsap.min.js"></script>
    <style>
      * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }
      html, body { width: 1920px; height: 1080px; overflow: hidden; background: #000; }
      body { font-family: "Inter", sans-serif; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root" data-composition-id="main" data-start="0" data-duration="10" data-width="1920" data-height="1080">
      <div id="title" class="clip" data-start="0" data-duration="5" data-track-index="1"
           style="position:absolute; inset:0; display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center; color:#fff; font-size:96px">
        Hello World
      </div>
    </div>
    <script>
      window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
      const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
      tl.from("#title", { opacity: 0, y: -50, duration: 1 }, 0)
        .to("#title", { opacity: 0, duration: 0.5 }, 4.5);
      window.__timelines["main"] = tl;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Authoring Patterns

- **Canvas per aspect ratio**: 16:9 -> 1920x1080, 9:16 -> 1080x1920, 1:1 -> 1080x1080. Set the same values in the viewport meta, the body CSS, and the root `data-width`/`data-height`.
- **Scenes**: one clip (or a group) per storyboard shot; set each clip's `data-start`/`data-duration` from the shot list so the timeline sums to the brief's duration.
- **On-screen text**: keep it inside the frame with padding; large, high-contrast type; one idea per scene.
- **Assets**: reference images/footage produced upstream by relative path inside the composition dir (e.g. `./assets/shot1.png`).
- **Timing**: position every tween on the GSAP timeline with an explicit time so it is reproducible; the total of `data-duration` on the root is the final length.
- **SVG-first visual layer**: prefer inline SVG for non-text motion graphics such as diagrams, connectors, nodes, progress paths, charts, orbit lines, icon-like marks, and background geometry. Keep readable prose in normal HTML text boxes unless the SVG text is large, simple, and verified.
- **Use GSAP only when time-based motion is needed**: static SVG, CSS layout, and simple held states do not need GSAP. When animation is needed, keep GSAP as the timeline/orchestration layer that animates SVG groups or a small set of HTML containers.
- **No remote runtime resources in final HTML**: do not leave CDN scripts, remote fonts, remote images, or remote CSS in the render path. Fetch or copy permitted runtime files into `project/composition/assets/` during authoring, then reference them with relative paths such as `./assets/vendor/gsap.min.js`. If you cannot source a permitted local GSAP/runtime file, report that blocker rather than shipping a network-dependent composition.
- **Local GSAP vendor**: `ovs composition prepare` and the draft path prepare the built-in offline GSAP vendor. Do not manually patch `assets/vendor/gsap.min.js`; fix manifest/HTML issues, or report the vendor blocker.

## Art Direction Before HTML

Before writing `project/composition/index.html`, write `project/composition/composition-manifest.json`. Treat its `art_direction` object as the composition budget, not a style note.

The contract must declare these budgets compactly:

- `composition`: id, width, height, approved duration, fps, language.
- `aesthetic`: from `frontend-design`: subject world, audience, one job, tone, signature device, aesthetic risk, and anti-template check.
- `visual_direction`: `VisualDirectionV1` from `frontend-design`: real design tradition/reference, composition behavior, lazy defaults rejected, video scale, depth-layer rule, motion-verb rule, typography register, and rhythm pattern. This is the front-loaded aesthetic director for HTML authoring, not a fixed template.
- `cover`: first canonical scene id, approved headline, at least two content signals, dominant hero, composition strategy, and `frame_time_sec:0`.
- `references` + `reference_fidelity`: required for every concrete reference image/video, with reproduce/edit/guide intent, roles, composition-local path, preserve/may-change boundary, target scenes, layout/temporal anchors, and scored verification floor.
- `style_source`: from `design-system-importer` when a DESIGN.md, brand guide, screenshot, reference site, Figma notes, existing app UI, or explicit named style was used. Omit when there is no external style source.
- `scenes`: canonical start/duration, approved on-screen copy, narration text/refs, source shots, and semantic roles. Put visual-only scene budgets under `art_direction.scenes[sceneId]`.
- `layout_boxes`: safe text box, visual box, caption box, and maximum label count per scene.
- `typography_tokens`: title/body/caption/label floors plus type roles and register. Default floors for 1920x1080: title >= 72px, body/supporting text >= 42px, safe margin >= 96px, no more than two text blocks and about 12-16 English words per scene. Preserve the same readability intent for 9:16 and 1:1. Preserve approved English casing by default: sentence/natural title case for titles and sentence case for body, captions, subtitles, and CTAs. Preserve all caps only when the user supplied that exact casing or an external brand requires it; model-authored art direction is not authorization, and broad `text-transform: uppercase` rules are forbidden. Avoid default two-sans pairings unless the style source explicitly requires them; use scale, weight, width, restrained case changes, mono/data roles, or serif/sans contrast to make hierarchy visible.
- `color_tokens`: named baseline values with rationale: background, surface, text, muted, primary accent, and any purposeful supporting accents the approved visual idea needs.
- `motion_budget`: max animated groups per scene, allowed transitions, easing, rhythm pattern, which SVG/HTML groups move, what each motion communicates, and the concrete motion verbs assigned to primary elements.
- `scene_variation`: how the sequence avoids three near-identical layouts, transitions, or card/title scenes in a row.
- `audio`: narration ownership, declarative local tracks, and the signed narration intent; use assembler ownership for silent AUTO segments.

The palette is a design contract, not a mechanical hue cap. The HTML/CSS/SVG should derive its main system from `color_tokens` through CSS variables or equivalent structured constants, but do not flatten or recolor a scene just to reduce a static color count.

The manifest is enforced, not advisory. `ovs composition prepare`, `ovs composition reconcile`, `ovs check`, `ovs snapshot`, and `ovs draft` validate its structural and design budgets. Repair the manifest and rerun; do not work around the gate. `ovs render` stays a raw diagnostic for work in progress.

In HTML, mark the topic-specific dominant cover visual with `data-role="visual" data-cover-hero` and at least two matching visible frame-0 elements with `data-cover-signal="<exact content_signals value>"`. Do not put those hooks on generic backgrounds, decoration, or the title.

Run a pre-code anti-template check from `frontend-design`: name the first generic design move you rejected and the brief-specific replacement. If you cannot name that replacement, the contract is not ready. The check should catch lazy defaults before HTML: purple/blue neon, glowing black-background circles, centered equal-weight layouts, identical cards, decorative emoji/icons, tiny badges, web-dashboard fragments, pure black/white, and web-scale type. When `style_source` exists, also name what was adapted, simplified, and not copied from the reference.

## Check And Repair Policy

Run the draft command before any user-facing video. If structural/source/audio/video QA fails, repair the highest canonical source and retry only after its signature changes. Bound repeated strategies, not recoverability: after two non-converging passes, preserve the evidence and choose a materially different localized repair. Technical QA never creates a user confirmation.

Repairs should address the cause, not just the symptom:

- `FONT_TOO_SMALL`: reduce text density, shorten copy, enlarge/reflow containers, or move labels out of small shapes. Do not simply increase every font size if that creates overflow.
- `missing_timeline_registry`, `gsap_timeline_not_registered`: register a paused GSAP timeline on `window.__timelines[compositionId]`, using the exact root `data-composition-id`.
- `timed_element_missing_clip_class`, `root_composition_missing_data_start`, `media_missing_data_start`, `imperative_media_control`: let the renderer own timing and media playback through `data-start`, `data-duration`, `.clip`, and media data attributes.
- `text_occluded`, `text_box_overflow`, `content_overlap`: restructure the scene layout or regenerate the affected scene from the contract's boxes. Do not rely on small numeric nudges.
- `FROZEN_FRAME_RUN`: treat repeated sampled frames as an advisory until semantic evidence confirms the timeline is frozen. Inspect the visual evidence; repair timeline registration, scene clip timing, or variation only when the frames actually fail to change as intended.

If only visual advisories remain and the draft render exists, present the mp4 draft with QA notes instead of silently looping. Repair the manifest or hand-authored HTML directly; do not introduce `spec.json` as a workaround.

After the draft render succeeds, use `composition-design-review` only as the fallback when preview was skipped and its trigger applies. A review blocker must be visible in a specific scene/frame and must break readability, the approved promise, required brand/style tokens, motion timing, or asset safety. Allow at most one localized repair and re-draft only for concrete blockers. Treat `fix` and `polish` findings as final-video confirmation notes.

## Narration / Audio Track

**WHO OWNS NARRATION -- decide this first:**

- **Standalone COMPOSE deliverable** (the composition IS the finished video, no assemble step): embed the narration as an `<audio>` track here; the renderer muxes it. Single add -- correct.
- **Composition is a SEGMENT in an AUTO/assemble pipeline** (the assembler will mix narration in its mix tier -- `stage-assemble` step 3): render this composition **SILENT -- do NOT add a narration `<audio>` track**. If you bake narration in here AND the assembler mixes it, narration is added twice and you get two overlapping, drifting voices. The mix step refuses a non-silent base by default to catch this.

To give a STANDALONE explainer a voiceover: synthesize the narration to an audio file with `ovs speak`, then add it as an **audio track** in the composition. The renderer muxes audio tracks into the output.

```html
<audio id="narration" src="./assets/narration.mp3"
       data-start="0" data-duration="60" data-track-index="0" data-volume="1"></audio>
```

- Declare audio in the manifest; reconcile generates the direct-child `<audio>` element. Its duration, the root duration, and the final scene end must agree with the approved delivery timeline.
- Before the first TTS call, estimate the script length from `video-craft` cadence (~150-160 wpm for explainers) and trim the text to the approved target duration. Do not synthesize multiple full versions just to discover timing. One full TTS pass plus at most one shortened retry is the limit.
- After the one successful synthesis, probe the produced file (`ovs edit probe project/composition/assets/narration.mp3`). If it differs from the estimate, keep the audio, retime manifest scene windows only within the approved delivery duration, update the narration track duration, then reconcile. Do **not** synthesize another full version merely to chase the original estimate.
- If an exact fixed duration was an explicit user constraint and the measured audio cannot be accommodated, stop and ask before another paid synthesis. Otherwise prefer the measured audio duration. This rule is for standalone COMPOSE; EDIT/AUTO may have supplied footage as the master timeline.
- If `ovs speak` fails, never silently continue: tell the user, then either fix and retry the narration or explicitly proceed silent with that stated at the gate.
- Use a project path such as `project/composition/assets/narration.mp3` so the composition stays self-contained.
- For background music plus voiceover, use two `<audio>` tracks with different `data-track-index` and lower the music `data-volume` (e.g. 0.2).
- **Talking-head caveat:** when this composition is being overlaid onto AI-generated talking-head footage that already has lip-synced built-in speech, do NOT add a narration `<audio>` track.

## Render (The Outcome)

Produce the finished video by running the draft gate over the composition **directory**. Iterate at draft quality, then do one high-quality pass once the layout and timing pass review:

- Draft: `ovs draft project/composition --out project/render/draft.mp4 --quality draft --report project/render/draft-report.json --findings project/composition/qa/check.json`
- Final: `ovs draft project/composition --out project/render/video.mp4 --quality high --report project/render/final-report.json --findings project/composition/qa/final-check.json`

Use `ovs render` only as a narrow diagnostic render when QA has already identified the blocker. User-facing drafts and finals go through `ovs draft` so contract, source, narration, media, and sampled-frame QA are not skipped.

After final-video approval, a local visual-only revision reuses the approved plan, assets, and narration. Change only the affected scene, run reconcile when needed, then `ovs check`, `ovs snapshot`, full-frame design review, and one revised high-quality encode. Do not request production-plan confirmation again or synthesize narration/generation again unless the requested edit changes signed copy, timing, language, narration, source mapping, or provider intent.

## Director Judgment (Compose Line)

Craft calls specific to designed/animated explainers, on top of the shared craft reference (video-craft):

- **One concept per visual chapter** -- do not stack two ideas in one scene; give each its own build.
- **Concrete before abstract** -- real data, diagrams, steps before a metaphor; the metaphor only lands once the concrete version is understood.
- **Aesthetic thesis before styling** -- use `frontend-design` to choose one signature visual device that comes from the subject matter; spend distinctiveness there and keep the rest disciplined.
- **Reference styles become tokens** -- use `design-system-importer` for DESIGN.md/brand/reference input, then adapt the tokens to video safe zones and motion. Do not clone protected layouts or assets.
- **Design review is a pre-preview guardrail** -- inspect the entire snapshot frame set before showing it; when preview is skipped, use the triggered post-draft fallback. Block only on concrete visible failures; template feel, hierarchy, and polish issues that do not break the promise become final-video confirmation notes.
- **Render exact text as real text** -- stats, names, CTAs are typed into the composition, never baked into AI imagery.
- **Build to the narration words**, not arbitrary beats; hold a fully-built scene/chart >= 2-3 s before moving on.
- **Vary scene types** -- no three near-identical layouts in a row; alternate full-frame / split / diagram / quote.
- **Spoken/readable captions live in the plan's `tracks.captions.lines` (data), NOT burned into this composition** -- the assembler burns them via `burnsubs` at the end, so a later typo fix is a one-line edit, not a re-render of the whole composition. Only a purely decorative caption treatment that is the visual design may live inside the composition.
- Surface craft-threshold warnings on the composition when you QA it before rendering. In draft mode, small readable text is a QA advisory rather than a render blocker; oversized palette is advisory and should be judged against the design thesis, brand, and scene clarity.

## Constraints

- Deterministic only: no real-time timers, no network-dependent runtime behavior, no randomness without a fixed seed -- the renderer seeks discrete frames.
- Keep all referenced assets inside the composition directory so the render is self-contained.
- This skill authors and renders compositions; it does not pick the production line (see `video-router`) or generate AI footage.
