# Tool Compatibility Matrix

What works on each platform for the Claude AI Music Skills plugin.

---

## Platform Support Overview

| Platform | Support Level | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **macOS** | Full | Primary development platform |
| **Linux** (native) | Full | Tested on Ubuntu 22.04+ |
| **WSL2** | Full | See [WSL Setup Guide](wsl-setup-guide.md) |
| **WSL1** | Partial | Works but slower, some limitations |
| **Windows (native)** | Full | The full test suite runs on windows-latest in CI, plus dedicated windows-latest legs for the MCP stdio boot check and MuseScore PDF export. Everything works: MCP server, state cache, non-audio workflow, the ffmpeg audio pipeline (mixing/mastering/codec preview), clipboard, promo video, and sheet music (MuseScore CI-verified; AnthemScore requires a licensed install — its trial has no CLI on **any** OS, so that caveat is not Windows-specific). Not the primary development platform, and promo video is verified by a real windows-latest render rather than continuously guarded — but that mock-only caveat applies on every OS, not just Windows (see the promo-video note below). |

> **What "CI-tested" does and does not mean here.** The full suite, the MCP stdio
> boot check, and the ffmpeg-gated *audio* tests (ADM validation, codec preview,
> mastering samples) genuinely execute on windows-latest. Promo **video** is
> different: all 62 of its tests mock `subprocess`, so no real render happens in
> CI on any OS. That gap hid a total failure — until the filtergraph escaping fix,
> every promo video and sampler clip failed on native Windows, because ffmpeg ate
> the backslashes in an unquoted `fontfile=C:\Windows\...`. It is now confirmed
> working by rendering a real frame on a windows-latest runner, but treat the
> "works" below as verified-by-hand rather than continuously guarded.

## Feature Compatibility Matrix

### Core Features (No Dependencies)

| Feature | macOS | Linux | WSL2 | Windows (native) | Requirements |
|---------|-------|-------|------|------------------|--------------|
| Album planning | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | None |
| Lyric writing | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | None |
| Suno prompts | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | None |
| Research skills | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | None |
| Album validation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | None |
| Configuration | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | None |

These have no external dependencies and are covered by the full suite plus the
MCP stdio boot check on windows-latest.

### Clipboard Skill

| Platform | Utility | Install |
|----------|---------|---------|
| macOS | `pbcopy` | Built-in |
| Linux | `xclip` | `sudo apt install xclip` |
| Linux (alt) | `xsel` | `sudo apt install xsel` |
| WSL2 | `clip.exe` | Built-in (Windows interop) |
| Windows (native) | `clip.exe` | Built-in (System32), via Git Bash |

**Notes**:
- SSH sessions: Clipboard unavailable (use X11 forwarding or copy manually)
- Headless Linux: xclip requires X11 display, use xsel with `--clipboard`
- Windows (native): supported. Verified on a windows-latest runner — Git Bash
  is present, the skill's detection chain selects the `clip.exe` branch,
  `clip.exe` resolves at `/c/Windows/system32/clip.exe`, and a copy round-trips
  via `Get-Clipboard`. PowerShell's `Set-Clipboard` also round-trips, so there
  is a native fallback if a bash is ever unavailable.
- This cannot be regression-tested in the normal suite: a headless runner has no
  clipboard, and the probe above was a one-off. Treat it as verified-by-hand.

### Audio Mastering

| Feature | macOS | Linux | WSL2 | Windows (native) | Requirements |
|---------|-------|-------|------|------------------|-----------------|
| LUFS analysis | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Python packages |
| Track mastering | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Python packages |
| Reference mastering | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Python packages |
| Genre presets | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Python packages |

The ffmpeg-gated audio tests (ADM validation, codec preview, mastering samples)
really execute on windows-latest — ffmpeg is installed there and CI asserts both
`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` resolve on PATH, so these cannot silently degrade to skips.

**Python Requirements**:

```bash
pip install matchering pyloudnorm scipy numpy soundfile
```

**System Requirements**:

| Platform | Additional Packages |
|----------|---------------------|
| macOS | None (soundfile bundles libsndfile) |
| Linux | `sudo apt install libsndfile1` |
| WSL2 | `sudo apt install libsndfile1` |

### Promo Video Generation

| Feature | macOS | Linux | WSL2 | Windows (native) | Requirements |
|---------|-------|-------|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Generate promos | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes¹ | ffmpeg, Python |
| All visualizations | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes¹ | ffmpeg with filters |
| Album sampler | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes¹ | ffmpeg, Python |
| Smart segments | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes¹ | + librosa, numpy |

¹ Verified by rendering a real frame on a windows-latest runner, **not** by
continuous CI — all 62 promo-video tests mock `subprocess`, so no real render is
guarded on any OS. Two Windows-specific fixes were required to get here, and
neither would have been caught by the existing tests:

- `find_font()` had no Windows candidates, so it returned `None` on every
  Windows host and there was no font to draw with.
- Paths were interpolated into the `drawtext` filtergraph unescaped. ffmpeg
  treats `:` as its option separator and `\` as an escape, so
  `fontfile=C:\Windows\Fonts\arialbd.ttf` was mangled to `C:WindowsFontsarialbd.ttf`
  and the whole graph was rejected. Paths now go through `escape_filter_path()`,
  which emits `'C\:/Windows/Fonts/arialbd.ttf'` — quoting alone is not enough,
  because the graph splits on `:` before quotes are processed.

**Requirements**:

```bash
# System
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# Linux/WSL: sudo apt install ffmpeg
# Windows (native): choco install ffmpeg

# Python
pip install pillow pyyaml
pip install librosa numpy  # Optional: for smart segment selection
```

**Required ffmpeg Filters**:

```bash
# Verify these filters are available
ffmpeg -filters 2>/dev/null | grep -E "showwaves|showfreqs|drawtext|gblur"
```

### Document Hunter (Playwright)

| Feature | macOS | Linux | WSL2 | Windows (native) | Requirements |
|---------|-------|-------|------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Browser automation | Yes | Yes | Partial | Untested | Playwright + Chromium |
| PDF downloads | Yes | Yes | Partial | Untested | Playwright + Chromium |

Playwright supports Windows natively, so this is expected to work — but nothing
in the Python suite exercises it on any platform, so it is marked untested rather
than supported.

**Requirements**:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium

# Linux/WSL only: install system dependencies
playwright install-deps chromium
```

**WSL Notes**:
- Works in headless mode
- GUI mode requires WSLg (Windows 11) or X11 server (Windows 10)

### Sheet Music Generation

| Feature | macOS | Linux | WSL2 | Windows (native) | Requirements |
|---------|-------|-------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Auto transcription | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes² | AnthemScore |
| PDF export | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes² | AnthemScore |
| Notation editing / PDF re-export | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes¹ | MuseScore |
| Songbook creation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | pypdf, reportlab |

Songbook creation is pure Python (pypdf/reportlab) and runs anywhere.

¹ **MuseScore on native Windows is CI-verified.** MuseScore is free with a real
CLI, so — unlike AnthemScore — its Windows path is testable. A `windows-latest`
leg of the MuseScore integration job installs it via Chocolatey (which lands it
at `C:\Program Files\MuseScore 4\bin\MuseScore4.exe`, the first entry in
`find_musescore()`'s Windows table), and `find_musescore()` detects it with no
help before exporting a real PDF. This runs on every PR, so it cannot silently
regress.

² **AnthemScore on native Windows requires a licensed install, and is not
independently CI-verified.** The blocker is *not* Windows-specific: the free
trial exposes no CLI on **any** OS (an unlicensed binary rejects every flag,
confirmed on the current macOS and Linux builds), and activation is device-based
so ephemeral runners can't be licensed. It is expected to work — AnthemScore is
a native-Windows application, `transcribe.py` knows its Windows install path and
uses the correct `where` locator (fixed in #498), and the CLI is confirmed
working on a licensed macOS install exercising the same code path. Not run on a
Windows box here.

**Software Requirements**:

| Tool | macOS | Linux | WSL2 | Windows (native) |
|------|-------|-------|------|------------------|
| AnthemScore | Native | Native | Run in Windows | Native (licensed) |
| MuseScore | Native | Native | WSLg or Windows | Native (CI-verified) |

**Notes**:
- AnthemScore: $42 (Professional edition), Windows/Mac/Linux
- **AnthemScore's CLI requires a licensed install.** The free trial exposes no
  command-line interface at all: an unlicensed binary rejects every option,
  including `--help`, with `AnthemScore: Unknown options: a, p, x, m.` Verified
  on the current macOS DMG and Linux AppImage. So `transcribe.py` works only
  against an activated copy — anyone evaluating the sheet-music workflow on the
  trial will hit that wall and reasonably conclude the tool is broken.
- This also means AnthemScore transcription **cannot be covered in CI**:
  activation is device-based (4 devices, plus one per year), and ephemeral
  runners present as a new device every run, so CI would exhaust the
  activations. Its tests are necessarily mock-only — unlike MuseScore, which is
  free and installable per-run and therefore has a real integration job.
- MuseScore: Free, open source
- WSL2: Run GUI apps in Windows, use WSL for CLI scripts

## Known Limitations by Platform

### macOS

- None significant

### Linux

- Clipboard requires X11 display (or use xsel for headless)
- Some older distros may have outdated ffmpeg

### WSL2

- GUI apps require Windows 11 (WSLg) or X11 server on Windows 10
- File operations on `/mnt/` slower than native filesystem
- Some Playwright features may require additional setup
- AnthemScore/MuseScore: Run in Windows, use CLI tools in WSL

### WSL1

- Slower than WSL2
- Limited Linux kernel compatibility
- Some npm/Python packages may have issues
- Recommend upgrading to WSL2

## Quick Dependency Check

Run this to verify your setup:

```bash
# Python
python3 --version

# Clipboard
if command -v pbcopy >/dev/null; then echo "macOS clipboard: OK"
elif command -v clip.exe >/dev/null; then echo "Windows/WSL clipboard: OK"
elif command -v xclip >/dev/null; then echo "Linux clipboard: OK"
else echo "Clipboard: MISSING"; fi

# ffmpeg
ffmpeg -version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "ffmpeg: MISSING"

# Python packages (if venv activated)
python3 -c "import soundfile" 2>/dev/null && echo "soundfile: OK" || echo "soundfile: MISSING"
python3 -c "import matchering" 2>/dev/null && echo "matchering: OK" || echo "matchering: MISSING"
python3 -c "import PIL" 2>/dev/null && echo "pillow: OK" || echo "pillow: MISSING"
```
