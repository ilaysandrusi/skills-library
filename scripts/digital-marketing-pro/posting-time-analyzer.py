"""Recommend social posting times — the brand's own data first, dated population
baselines second, never a timeless table.

THE LADDER
----------
1. FIRST-PARTY (--history): the brand's own posts with timestamps and
   engagement. Population averages describe everyone's audience, which is no
   one's audience; only the brand's history can earn "high" confidence. The
   aggregation is honest statistics: minimum sample sizes per bucket, sample
   counts in the output, and a refusal to rank buckets it cannot support.
2. SHIPPED BASELINE: curated population windows, stamped with BASELINE_AS_OF
   and capped at MEDIUM confidence (a population average can never be high-
   confidence for a specific audience). The stamp AGES: past 180 days every
   output carries a re-verify warning; past 540 days the baseline REFUSES
   (exit 3) and instructs a live refresh or --history. A timing table that
   cannot expire is a 2024 opinion wearing a 2026 date.

WHY TIMING STILL MATTERS (2026): every major feed uses recency as a ranking
signal — engagement in the first 30-60 minutes seeds wider distribution — but
interest-ranked feeds (TikTok especially) have made WHAT you post dominate
WHEN you post it. Baseline windows are test starting points, not answers.

Usage:
    python posting-time-analyzer.py --platform instagram
    python posting-time-analyzer.py --platform linkedin --industry saas --audience-type b2b
    python posting-time-analyzer.py --platform instagram --history posts.json
      history format: [{"posted_at": "2026-07-03T11:20:00", "engagement": 412}, ...]
      (engagement = likes+comments+shares+saves, or any consistent metric)
