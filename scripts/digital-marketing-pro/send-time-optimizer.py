"""Recommend email send times — the list's own history first, dated population
baselines second, and the ESP's per-recipient optimization above both.

THE LADDER
----------
0. ESP SEND-TIME OPTIMIZATION: if the connected email platform offers
   per-recipient STO, it outperforms ANY global window (current platform
   reports: 5-15% open-rate lift) — every output says so. Global windows are
   for platforms without STO, first sends to new lists, and A/B baselines.
1. FIRST-PARTY (--history): the brand's own send log with opens. Only the
   list's measured behavior can earn "high" confidence. Honest statistics:
   minimum send counts per bucket, sample sizes in the output, refusal to
   rank what the data cannot support.
2. SHIPPED BASELINE: curated population windows, stamped with BASELINE_AS_OF,
   capped at MEDIUM confidence, aging out (warn >180d, REFUSE >540d, exit 3).
