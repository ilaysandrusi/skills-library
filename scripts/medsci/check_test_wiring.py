"""A test CI never runs is a test that never runs — the third sibling of the reachability gates.

`check_detector_reachability.py` asks whether a *skill* calls a detector.
`check_script_reachability.py` asks whether a *skill* calls a script.
Both docstrings say the same thing out loud:

    "A test, a challenge card, or a CI step does NOT make a script reachable."

That sentence closes one direction and leaves the other one open, and nothing else was watching it.
The open direction is this: a challenge card can sit on disk, be listed in its skill's
`validation_commands`, be counted in the distribution manifest, be announced in the CHANGELOG — and
never be named in a workflow. It is green because it is never run. On 2026-07-25, with the two
reachability gates in place and 202 `run:` steps hand-listed in `validate.yml`, twelve test assets
were in exactly that state, six of them declared in a `skill.yml` as validation commands. Four more
had been in it until PR #412 wired them by hand, one at a time, after a manual sweep found them.

The manual sweep is the bug. A hand-maintained list of "tests CI should run" has no gate that
catches an omission, so the omission is invisible for as long as nobody happens to look.

A test asset is WIRED if:
  * a `run:` step in any `.github/workflows/*.yml` names its path, or
  * a NON-TEST file that a `run:` step names contains its path (one hop — `validate_skills.sh` runs
    `tests/test_precedent_hashing.sh`, and that counts).

The hop deliberately excludes test assets themselves, and that exclusion is load-bearing rather than
tidy: the first draft let any wired file vouch for a path, and this gate's own self-test — which
names a challenge in a shell variable in order to *delete its step* — thereby certified that
challenge as wired. The gate passed its own regression case by reading its own source. A test that
mentions another test is not running it, which is the sibling gates' doctrine one category over.

Being declared in `skill.yml` does NOT make it wired: `validation_commands` is documentation of how
to run a thing, and CI does not read it. That gap is what this gate exists to close.

Exemptions live in EXEMPT below and each one carries a reason. There is no `--strict`: a violation
exits 1 always, because a gate that reports a failure while exiting 0 is the failure mode this
repository keeps re-learning.

Usage:
    check_test_wiring.py [--root DIR] [--json] [--quiet]

Needs PyYAML (maintainer tool, same as run_ci_mirror.py).
