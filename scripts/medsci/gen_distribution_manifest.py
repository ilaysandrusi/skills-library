"""Generate the two deterministic distribution manifests (v4.x self-update foundation).

Two tracked, byte-deterministic files (no build timestamps / sha-of-build), each CI
`--check`-gated:

  metadata/distribution_manifest.json
    Small ownership/version manifest: {schema_version, version, owned_skills}.
    `version` is copied from CITATION.cff (the canonical version SSOT); a separate
    consistency check (scripts/check_version_consistency.py) asserts
    CITATION.cff == package.json == this file.

  metadata/distribution_files.json
    Deterministic inventory [{path, size, sha256}] of the **classroom/common install
    payload** — the file set the classroom ZIP ships (README_FIRST.md, installers/,
    skills/, and these two metadata manifests). It is the SSOT for (a) this CI check
    (the on-disk payload matches the inventory) and (b) the updater's ZIP
    safe-extraction allowlist + per-file hash (PR-1b). It deliberately **excludes
    itself** and the build-time `provenance.json` (injected by the release workflow,
    not tracked). It describes the *common* payload, not every file in any one
    channel (npm ships extra files such as bin/ and package.json that are NOT here).

Stdlib-only, deterministic (sorted, POSIX paths). Usage:
  python3 scripts/gen_distribution_manifest.py          # write both files
  python3 scripts/gen_distribution_manifest.py --check   # verify in sync; exit 1 on drift (CI gate)
