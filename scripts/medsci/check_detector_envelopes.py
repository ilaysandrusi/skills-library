"""Every detector's JSON output must name the detector that produced it.

A verification layer whose artifacts cannot be traced back to the check that produced
them is only half a verification layer. Until now the qc/*.json envelopes carried the
findings but not the finding's author: a consumer aggregating a project's qc directory —
a dashboard, an audit trail, the review-harvest precision ledger — had to infer the
detector from the *filename*, which is chosen freely at the call site (`--out qc/cs3.json`,
`--out qc/v13_scope.json`). Two runs of one detector under different filenames read as two
detectors; one detector run under an unexpected filename read as none.

So the contract is: any detector that emits JSON emits `"detector": "<its own id>"` in the
envelope. This gate enforces it statically, so a new detector cannot ship without it.

It is deliberately a source check rather than an execution check: detectors need fixtures,
credentials, and sometimes a network to run, but the envelope key is a literal in the
source and can be verified without any of that.

Exit 0 when every JSON-emitting detector self-identifies. With --strict, exit 1 otherwise.
