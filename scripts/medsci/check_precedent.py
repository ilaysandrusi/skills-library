"""Precedent / personal-identifier scan (self-doxxing-safe).

`validate_skills.sh` blocks project-specific identifiers from reaching the public
surface. Historically the blocklist was a single plaintext regex inside the
validator — which meant the maintainer's name, mentor names, and internal project
codes were themselves enumerated in cleartext in the public repo (the self-doxxing
trade-off noted in oss-publication-pii-guard §5). This helper resolves that by
splitting the blocklist into two layers:

  1. STRUCTURAL — generic project/artifact *shapes* that are not themselves
     personally identifying (CK-<n>, MA-<n>, <X><n>_Consensus_Sheet, ...). These
     stay as plaintext regex below; revealing them dox nobody.

  2. HASHED LITERALS — real names, mentor initials, institutions, product names,
     and specific project codes. Stored only as SHA-256 digests in
     precedent_hashes.txt, never in cleartext. Detection tokenises the scanned
     text into word n-grams (1..MAX_NGRAM), lowercases, and hashes each, matching
     against the digest set. The scanned text may itself contain a term (that is
     what we are catching); the runtime match is shown to the local author, but
     the committed blocklist stays hash-only.

Exit codes: 0 = clean, 3 = precedent hit found (first hit printed as
"<lineno>:<match>"), other = usage/IO error. Stdlib-only.

    # check disagreed and the strictest was not the one guarding the repository.

    # Korean word precedes the role — `지도 교수`, `담당 교수` are job descriptions, not people,

    # at that position, and the leftover single syllable cannot satisfy {2,4}, so the whole
