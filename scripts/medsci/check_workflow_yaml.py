"""The workflow files must parse — because a broken one does not fail, it VANISHES.

On 2026-07-14 a step was added named:

    - name: Run deck-budget challenge (same deck: fits an oral, too dense for a keynote)

The `: ` inside an unquoted YAML scalar made the line a mapping, and `validate.yml` stopped being
valid YAML. GitHub did not run a single job. `gh pr checks` reported **"no checks reported on the
branch"** — not a red X, not a failure anyone would notice at a glance. The run existed, it was
"failure", and it contained **zero jobs**, so there was nothing to look at.

That is the most dangerous shape a failure can take: every gate in the repository — the PII scanner,
the detector-envelope contract, the manifest, all 153 steps — was silently not running, and the pull
request looked *quiet* rather than *broken*. A person who merges on green would have merged on
nothing.

So the workflow files are parsed like any other artifact, and the specific trap that caused it is
called out by name.

Stdlib only (no PyYAML — this must run before anything installs anything).

Usage:
    check_workflow_yaml.py [--strict]
