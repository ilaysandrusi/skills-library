"""Vendoring drift gate — every vendored set, not just the one we remembered.

Skills ship standalone (`/publish-skill`), so a runtime cross-skill import is forbidden.
Build-time vendoring — keep one canonical copy, copy it byte-identical into the consuming skill —
is the portability-preserving pattern (see docs/dedup_audit.md; same idea as the vendored citation
writer). It is only safe if something asserts the copies never drift apart.

This gate used to guard exactly ONE vendored set: the domain probes. Meanwhile SIX risk-of-bias
checklists (RoB2, NOS, ROBINS_I, QUADAS2, PROBAST, PRISMA_DTA) were vendored from `/check-reporting`
into `/meta-analysis` byte-identically and gated by NOTHING. No drift had happened yet — but the
probes prove the maintainer already believes this guard is necessary, and the checklists were simply
forgotten. A guard that exists for one instance of a pattern and not for its twin is not a guard;
it is a coincidence.

So the gate is now table-driven (`VENDOR_SETS`) AND self-discovering:

  1. DECLARED SETS — for each set: same files on both sides, byte-identical (sha256).
  2. UNDECLARED VENDORING — hash every file under skills/ and flag any content that appears in
     TWO OR MORE skills without being declared above. This is the part that makes a THIRD vendored
     set impossible to forget: you do not have to remember to add it to the table, because the gate
     finds it and fails until you do.

Step 2 is why this file does not need to be renamed every time a new pair is vendored. It is the
vendoring gate, not the domain-probe gate; the filename is kept only because ~50 files (including
the header of every vendored probe) point at it by name.

Modes:
  --strict : exit 1 on any drift / missing / extra / undeclared duplicate. Wired into CI and
             validate_skills.sh.
  --sync   : copy canonical -> vendored for every declared set (the one-command fix).
  --root   : operate on an alternate tree (used by tests/test_vendoring_sync.sh).

Stdlib-only. Exit codes: 0 in sync (or after --sync), 1 drift (with --strict), 2 a dir is missing.
