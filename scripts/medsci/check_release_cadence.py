"""A release is an event, not a commit. This stops us from pretending otherwise.

In the 37 days to 2026-07-13 this repository cut **42 releases** — a median gap of **zero
days**, three of them on one afternoon. Three things follow, and all three are worse than they
look:

  1. THE RELEASE STOPS MEANING ANYTHING. A user who sees forty-nine releases does not read a
     changelog; they wonder whether the thing is stable. A version number that changes daily is
     a commit log with extra ceremony.

  2. IT DESTROYS OUR OWN ADOPTION SIGNAL. Every release attracts a handful of automated asset
     downloads (mirrors, scanners, crawlers), so `release_downloads` grows with the *number of
     releases* rather than the number of users. Per-release downloads collapsed from 32 to 5
     across that window while the cumulative total doubled — and the cumulative total is the
     number we were about to cite as evidence of adoption. Cadence is a **measurement**
     decision, not only a shipping one.

  3. IT MAKES THE VERSION USELESS AS A COORDINATE. "Which version were you on?" stops being
     answerable when there were four that week.

So: **a release needs a reason to exist, and a gap since the last one.** Ship the work to `main`
continuously — that is what `main` is for — and let releases accumulate into something a person
would want to read about.

Exemption, and only this one: a **hotfix**. Something shipped is broken (it will not install, it
loses data, it is a security problem, or it produced a wrong result that a user might have
believed). Those go out immediately, and say so in the changelog:

    ## [5.20.1] - 2026-07-11

    **Hotfix:** `/orchestrate --e2e` halted at step 3 requiring a DOCX only rendered at step 7,
    so an end-to-end run could not complete.

Usage:
    check_release_cadence.py [--min-days 14] [--strict]

It is a no-op unless a release is actually being prepared: if `CITATION.cff` still declares the
version of the newest tag, there is nothing to check and it exits 0. Stdlib only (shells to git).

# The second exemption, and the reason it is not a loophole.
#
# Reason 3 above is that a version stops being a coordinate when there were four of them that
# week. A measurement study inverts that: an experiment that reports "42 detectors, false-positive
# rate X" has to name the artifact it measured, and a git SHA is a worse coordinate than a release
# for anyone trying to reproduce it. So a release cut *in order to be cited* serves the same end
# the waiting period serves, and waiting would not improve it.
#
# It is narrow by construction: the changelog must name the external artifact that needs the pin,
# and the gate prints that name, so an unjustified use is visible in the CI log of the release that
# used it. It does NOT waive the substance requirement — a version worth citing is a version worth
# updating to.
