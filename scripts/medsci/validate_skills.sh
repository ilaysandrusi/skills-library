# validate_skills.sh — Lint all medsci-skills for required structure
# Run from repo root: bash scripts/validate_skills.sh
#                     bash scripts/validate_skills.sh --only <skill-name>
#
# `--only` exists because the validator's own self-tests were paying for the whole repo. Fixing the
# find-glob bug (#435) took this script from reading 58 files to ~1,200, and the two tests written
# to prove that fix works each invoke the validator again — so CI ran the full scan three times and
# the `validate` job went from 3m57s to 5-7 minutes. Nothing was wrong with either test; the cost
# was structural, because the validator took no arguments and a test that needs to observe ONE
# fixture skill had no way to ask for less than all of them.
#
# It is a test affordance, not a release gate. A scoped run deliberately does NOT print the verdict
# a full run prints — see the exit block. A cheap gate is one that actually gets run; a gate whose
# partial result reads identically to its full result is worse than a slow one.

  # A corporate domain from a personal author roster used to sit on that whitelist, and the note

  # exempt from the precedent scan (this one — see the self-exemption below) was the file
  # publishing a colleague's name and work address in cleartext, inside the comment explaining
  # why doing so was safe. It was neither safe nor true: that address was run against the
  # blocklist and MISSED. Entry and note are both gone; the address and its bare domain are now
  # hashed in precedent_hashes.txt, so a reappearance anywhere scannable fails instead of being
  # waved through. A whitelist entry must never carry the string it exempts.
  # `@nejm.org` and `users.noreply.github.com` joined the list in 2026-07-29, when
  #   this rule started scanning references/ and scripts/ for the first time: a
  #   journal's published editorial-office address and a GitHub noreply sender are
  #   contact information, not a person's private address.
  #
  # Two files exist in order to CARRY personal-looking data, and exempting them is
  # not a loophole but the only way they can do their job: they are the corpora
  # that prove the PII detectors fire. `deidentify` needs Korean PHI shapes
  # (resident-registration numbers, phone numbers, addresses) and `contribute`
  # needs a message that leaks an author's address, so that each skill's scanner
  # can be shown catching them. Every other rule still applies to them; only this
  # one is skipped, and only for these two paths.
  #
  # This note used to carry two further claims, and a 2026-08-15 audit found BOTH false:
  #
  #   "Both are fully synthetic." The names, national IDs, addresses and hospital ARE
  #   invented. A journal submission ID in the `contribute` fixture was not — it belonged
  #   to a manuscript the maintainer had actually reviewed. The verification behind the
  #   word "synthetic" had been done name by name, and the ID is not a name, so it was
  #   never in scope. State what a check covered, not what it felt like it covered.
  #
  #   "Neither ships (tests/ is excluded from the distribution bundle)." True of the
  #   classroom ZIP. FALSE of the npm package, which ships `skills/**/tests/`. The claim
  #   was written from one distribution channel and asserted over all of them.
  #
  # An exemption is a place where nothing downstream will check the reasoning, so the
  # reasoning has to be checked here. Anything added to this list is exempt from the
  # scanner AND from the review the scanner would have prompted. Verify the claim you
  # write, against every channel, before adding a path below.

# Full tracked-text scan OUTSIDE skills/ (skills/ is covered by the per-skill

# metadata were never scanned — a hospital-name + incoming-fellowship PII
# reached public main while the validator reported PASS (validator PASS !=
# security PASS). Uses `git ls-files` so privatized (gitignored) drafts are
# excluded and only the public surface is gated; the gate is "0 hits", not a
# fixed file count.
#
# Self-exemption: this script + check_precedent.py + precedent_hashes.txt carry
# the blocklist machinery (structural regex, PERSONAL_PATH, SHA-256 digests).
# Scanning them would self-match the structural shapes. Excluded explicitly.
#
# Author-attribution allowlist: README.md / CITATION.cff / paper.md /
# .zenodo.json legitimately carry the maintainer's own name for citation. For
# those files the precedent scan runs with --allow-author (the author's own name
# digest is exempted), so other PII (hospital, project codes, personal paths) on
# the same line is still caught. The author name is no longer spelled out here.
#
# `README.<locale>.md` is matched as a FAMILY rather than enumerated. The first translated
# README (zh-CN) failed CI on its byline — the same "Created & maintained by ..." line README.md
# carries and is allowlisted for. A translation carries that byline by definition, so every
# future locale hits the identical wall, and enumerating them one at a time rebuilds the wall
# per language. The allowance stays narrow: `--allow-author` exempts only the author-name digest,
# so a hospital name, a project code or a personal path in a translated README is still caught
# exactly as it is in the English one.
