"""A detector nothing calls is a detector that never runs.

We count every detector in the catalog. We test them in CI. We give each one a challenge card with a
positive and a negative fixture, and a JSON envelope that names itself. All of that proves a detector **works**.

None of it proves the skill **calls** it.

On 2026-07-14 a sweep found five — `check_table_percentages`, `check_reported_p_from_counts`,
`check_dta_denominators`, `check_nested_group_comparison`, `check_paired_difference_estimator` —
that were shipped in v5.20.0 with challenge cards, CI steps, catalog entries and a release note, and
that **`self-review/SKILL.md` never mentioned**. They passed every gate we had and had never once run
on a real manuscript. They were counted in the number we publish.

This is the same disease as a green test that would not catch the defect, one level up: the gate was
verifying the tool instead of the *use* of the tool.

A detector is REACHABLE if:
  * some SKILL.md invokes it by filename, or
  * a non-test script that is itself reachable invokes it (e.g. a preflight gate that runs a bundle).

A challenge card, a test, or a CI step does NOT make it reachable. Those prove it works in a
laboratory. They are exactly what these five had.

Usage:
    check_detector_reachability.py [--strict]

Stdlib only.
