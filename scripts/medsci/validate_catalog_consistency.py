"""Catalog-count consistency check (codex Improvement A).

Counts cited in public docs (skill count, reporting-guideline count, journal-
profile counts) were hand-maintained in multiple places and drifted (README once
said "22 guidelines" while orchestrate said "15"; more recently every doc said
"33 reporting guidelines" while only 32 are enumerated and vendored). This makes
the counts a single source of truth and fails CI on drift.

Four layers:
  1. Recompute every count from disk (the real ground truth).
  2. Assert metadata/catalog_counts.json matches disk — the SSOT cannot lie.
     Exception: the journal-profile counts (``AUTO_DERIVED_KEYS``) are recomputed
     from disk but never asserted against the JSON, so that adding one profile —
     the single-file change the "add a journal profile" good-first-issue (#115)
     invites from a first-time contributor — can never fail on a count bump they
     have no reason to know about. Those counts are cited in no checked doc claim,
     so disk is their sole source of truth.
  3. Assert the count claims in the public docs match the SSOT. Guideline claims are
     matched (case-insensitively, so a "### 33 Reporting Guidelines" heading is caught)
     by "guidelines" or "checklists", optionally qualified by "reporting"/"EQUATOR"/
     "vendored", across README, orchestrate, check-reporting, the figure map,
     CITATION.cff, and paper.md (the JOSS submission). The skill self-count is checked
     in the "skills that actually work" tagline, the README shields badge
     (img.shields.io/badge/Skills-N-), and catalog-total prose ("All N skills",
     "N task-bounded skills"). The badge regex is scoped to the shields URL so arbitrary
     prose never trips it, and comparison/marketing lines about *other* repos
     ("400-900 skills", "869 skills") are never touched. Dated version notes (2- or
     3-component, e.g. **v5.20.1**) are skipped for every current-claim scan.
  4. Assert the MEDSCI_AUDIT per-family detector table against the generated
     metadata/detectors_catalog.json — each row's count against that family's true
     size, and its listed names against that family's true membership. Layer 3 already
     watched the "The N detectors fall into six audit families" total; nothing watched
     the rows under it, and they drifted to 72 against a total of 80.

Exit 0 when everything agrees; non-zero on any drift. Stdlib-only.
