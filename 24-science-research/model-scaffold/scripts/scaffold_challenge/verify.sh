# Deterministic verifier for the model-scaffold challenge card — the build->validate
# chain, executed network-free.
#
#   (1) scaffold.py stamps a runnable PyTorch segmentation repo from a synthetic
#       manifest (stdlib + numpy; no torch needed to GENERATE).
#   (2) the emitted split_assignment.csv matches the frozen, deterministic expected
#       split, and is patient-disjoint by construction (proven inline here — no
#       cross-skill dependency).
#   (3) the emitted train.py / evaluate.py pass check_training_hygiene (this skill's
#       own AST linter): all RNGs seeded, cuDNN deterministic, eval()+no_grad().
#   (4) TORCH TIER (self-skipping): if torch is installed, build model.py, assert the
#       forward output shape, that gradients flow, and that the loss is reproducible
#       under a fixed seed. If torch is absent it prints SKIP and exits 0 — this is a
#       documented local/optional check, NEVER counted as CI coverage of runnability.
#
# Synthetic fixture only (no real images, no PII). Exit 0 = build->validate holds.
