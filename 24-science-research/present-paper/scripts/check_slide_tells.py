"""Find the marks an AI leaves on a slide deck — in the built .pptx, not in the build script.

People can tell. Reviewers report that a third of the decks they now see were made by an AI, that
they can spot it immediately, and that the tell is not ugliness — it is that the deck stops
communicating. "무슨 말을 하고 싶은 것인지 전달이 잘 안 된다." The maker was made comfortable; the
audience was not served.

The marks are mechanical, which means they can be caught mechanically:

  CHROME_ON_EVERY_SLIDE  the little words along the top and bottom edges of every slide — the
                         all-caps eyebrow label, the "2026 · NEUROGENETICS" brand footer. They
                         carry no information, they appear because a template said to, and they are
                         the first thing a reader's eye registers as machine-made. This project's
                         own house style *mandated* them, which is how we shipped the tell.

  SCAFFOLD_PHRASE        "핵심은 ~라는 점이다." "요약하자면." "단순히 A가 아니라 B이다." "이는 세
                         가지 층위에서 살펴볼 수 있다." "As we saw above." These are not thoughts.
                         They are the *record of a thought being assembled* — a model narrating its
                         own steps. A person thinks A→B→C→D in silence and writes down only D; a
                         model says "having done B, I will now do C" and leaves the sentence in.
                         Scaffolding is what a writer removes in revision. AI delivers the
                         scaffolding still bolted to the building.

  TOPIC_TITLE            A content slide titled "Results" instead of saying what the result WAS.
                         The headline is the one line everyone reads; spending it on a filing label
                         means the point must be excavated from the body. (Assertion-evidence:
                         Alley & Neeley 2005.)

  SHAPE_MONOTONY         The same rounded rectangle, eight times, at the same size. A person draws
                         the shape the idea needs; a generator reaches for the shape it has.

  DEAD_SPACE_BAND        A wide empty stripe between objects — not negative space, which is chosen,
                         but the gap left when boxes are placed by a layout rule rather than an eye.

  ARROW_NO_SEMANTICS     Two or more arrows in a diagram and not one of them labelled. An arrow is
                         a claim: causes, becomes, flows into, is compared with. An unlabelled arrow
                         is read differently by every person in the room, and one wrong arrow can
                         derail a whole discussion.

What this does NOT do: judge whether the deck is beautiful, or whether AI was used. AI used as a
*booster* leaves none of these marks. AI used as a *button* leaves all of them.

Stdlib only — it reads the .pptx as the ZIP of XML that it is, so it runs on any deck from anyone
(PowerPoint, Keynote export, a colleague's file) with nothing installed.

    """Shapes carrying text that `parse_shape` throws away — and why that is a hole, not a nicety.

    A placeholder inherits its position and size from the layout. Assign ONE of them —
    `shape.width = Inches(11.5)` — and python-pptx materialises an `<a:xfrm>` for the whole
    shape, writes the value it was given, and records the rest as **absent or zero** rather than
    as inherited. What renders is a box with no width, or no height: the text is in the file and
    is not on the slide.

    That is a rendering bug, and it is also a hole in this toolkit. `parse_shape` requires both
    `<a:off>` and `<a:ext>` and returns None without them, so such a shape — with its word count
    and its type size — leaves the deck before any check sees it. On 2026-08-09 a title slide
    carrying 69 words at 11.5 pt passed `check_deck_budget`; fixing the coordinates surfaced
    three findings that had been there the whole time. **The green was produced by the defect** —
    the one shape of passing check that proves nothing at all. The same builder mistake recurred
    on 2026-08-14 on a different deck, by which point it had cost twice.

    Returns (slide number, what is wrong, the first line of the text that is hiding).

    A placeholder with **no** `<a:xfrm>` at all is the normal case — full inheritance, correct,
    and common — and is not reported. The signature here is a *partial* xfrm, which nothing but a
    half-finished assignment writes.

    sits at the bottom edge and every ordinary title-then-body slide has a gap under its headline.
    A check that fires on good work is a check that gets switched off, and it takes the other five

    around it has the second and not the first. Only a slide that is both mostly empty AND has a
