"""Build the two fixture decks the challenge runs against.

They are BUILT, not committed: a .pptx is a binary, and a binary fixture is a fixture nobody ever
reads again. Building it means the tells are written down in Python, where the next person can see
exactly what "an AI-made deck" means here and disagree with me.

  tells.pptx   every mark check_slide_tells looks for, planted on purpose.
  clean.pptx   the same content, made the way a person makes it — and it must come back CLEAN.
               This is the half that matters. A checker that only ever fires is a checker that will
               be turned off.

Needs python-pptx (CI installs it). Writes into the directory given as argv[1].
