"""Is this deck the right shape for the room it is going into?

Forty words on a slide is a normal academic slide and a catastrophic keynote slide. Thirty slides is
right for a fifty-minute lecture and fatal for a ten-minute oral abstract. There is no universal
threshold for "too much text" — there is only too much text *for this podium*, which is why this
takes an archetype instead of pretending one number fits every room.

It checks the things about a deck that are mechanical, and therefore checkable:

  DECK_OVER_BUDGET    slides against the clock. A 40-slide deck for a 10-minute oral is not a
                      style choice; it is a talk that will be cut off at the microphone.
  SLIDE_TOO_DENSE     words on a slide, against what this archetype's audience can absorb while
                      also listening to you. A keynote audience is not reading.
  TYPE_TOO_SMALL      the back row exists. Below the floor, the slide is decoration.
  ZERO_AREA_TEXT      text sitting in a box with no width or no height. Nothing below can measure
                      it, so the three checks above are unreliable until it is fixed — and a deck
                      in this state passes them by being unreadable rather than by being right.

The clock stops at the backup section. Nearly every conference deck carries one — the slides you
do not present, and open only if someone asks. Counting them against the clock told people to
delete their Q&A preparation, so the check was wrong in the one place a speaker most needs to be
prepared. A slide whose headline is "Backup", "Appendix", "Q&A", "Reserve" or "Supplementary" ends
the talk: everything from there on is off the clock.

Density and type size still apply to those slides. Anything you might put on a screen has to be
readable when it gets there; a backup slide is shown under questioning, which is the worst possible
moment to discover it is a wall of 11-point text.

Everything else about an archetype — whether the argument opens with its answer, whether the case is
a pretext, whether the limitation is the one that matters — is judgment, and is in
`references/presentation_archetypes.md` where a person can act on it.

Stdlib only. Reads the .pptx as the ZIP of XML it is.
