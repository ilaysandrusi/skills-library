# Medical Presentation Templates

Section structure, slide counts, and design tone for the four medical presentation
contexts handled by this skill. Each template is a starting outline — not a rigid
template. Adapt to specific paper, audience, and time slot.

## 1. Journal club (paper-driven, peer trainees)

**Audience**: residents / fellows + 1–2 faculty. Same-specialty cohort.
**Time**: 20–30 min total (10–15 min present + remainder discussion).
**Tone**: Methodologically rigorous, critical, peer-collegial.
**Slide count**: ~20–25 (1 slide / 30–60 s).

### Section structure

| # | Section | Slides | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title + COI | 1 | Paper citation, presenter, date, disclosure |
| 2 | Why this paper | 1 | Clinical question that led to selection |
| 3 | Background | 1–2 | Existing evidence, what's known vs unknown |
| 4 | Research question (PICO) | 1 | Population / Intervention / Comparison / Outcome |
| 5 | Study design | 1–2 | Schema diagram of arms, randomization, follow-up |
| 6 | Methods | 1–2 | Cohort, eligibility, primary outcome, statistical plan |
| 7 | Results | 3–5 | Primary outcome figure, key tables, subgroup if relevant |
| 8 | Strengths / Weaknesses | 1 | 2-column slide (per `critic_rubrics/slide.md` G.30) |
| 9 | Limitations | 1 | Author-acknowledged + presenter-identified |
| 10 | Statistical vs clinical significance | 1 | Effect size + NNT / absolute risk reduction |
| 11 | Clinical implications | 1 | How this changes (or doesn't change) practice |
| 12 | Take-home messages | 1 | 3 bullet points, no more |
| 13 | References / Q&A | 1 | Inline citations + key supporting refs |

### Design seed
- **Color**: Institutional accent (1) + neutral grays (2). No 3-D, no decorative animation.
- **Typography**: Sans-serif (Helvetica / Calibri / Pretendard for KR). 28 pt title /
  18–20 pt body.
- **Figures**: Use figures from the paper directly (cite slide-corner). Do not re-render
  unless adding emphasis annotations.
- **Speaker note density**: 5–10 s of spoken content per slide.

### Pre-presentation checklist
- [ ] Faculty review of paper selection (per UAB framework — verify educational
      significance, relevance for practice, validity).
- [ ] Read paper independently before reading the abstract (avoid author-framing bias).
- [ ] Allocate ~50% of total time to discussion, not lecture.
- [ ] Verify `submission_safe: true` is not needed (journal club ≠ submission).

## 2. Grand rounds (mixed specialty / mixed seniority)

**Audience**: Multi-specialty, mixed trainee + attending. May include non-radiologists for
imaging-themed rounds.
**Time**: 45–60 min total (35–45 min present + remainder Q&A).
**Tone**: Educational, broadly accessible, single-take-home framing.
**Slide count**: ~30–45 (1 slide / 60–90 s, with worked examples).

### Section structure

| # | Section | Slides | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title + COI + Acknowledgments | 1–2 | Title, presenter affiliation, disclosure, mentor credit |
| 2 | Learning objectives | 1 | 3–4 specific objectives (verb + noun pattern) |
| 3 | Hook / clinical case | 1–2 | A real (de-identified) case that motivates the topic |
| 4 | Why this matters now | 1 | Burden / incidence / unmet clinical need |
| 5 | Background (concept review) | 2–3 | Pathophysiology / imaging principles, accessible level |
| 6 | Current standard of care | 1–2 | Where the field is today, what the gap is |
| 7 | Recent evidence | 5–8 | 2–3 key papers; one slide per take-home |
| 8 | Worked imaging examples | 4–8 | Side-by-side cases illustrating each teaching point |
| 9 | Practice algorithm / decision tree | 1–2 | Synthesis: how to apply in daily practice |
| 10 | Limitations of current evidence | 1 | Honest framing of what we still don't know |
| 11 | Future directions | 1 | Trials in progress, AI/computational angles if relevant |
| 12 | Take-home messages | 1 | Map back to learning objectives |
| 13 | Return to opening case | 1 | Show how the talk's content alters the case management |
| 14 | Q&A / References | 1 | Inline cites throughout; reference handout if requested |

### Design seed
- **Color**: Institutional palette + 1 accent for highlights. Avoid >3 colors per slide.
- **Typography**: Title 32 pt / body 20–22 pt (room may seat ≥ 100).
- **Figures**: Mix of paper figures, original imaging, and SMART Servier anatomical icons.
  AI-image disclosure if anything is AI-generated.
- **Worked examples**: Build-up animations acceptable (sequential reveal of imaging
  findings) — but only when the build encodes a teaching step.

### Pre-presentation checklist
- [ ] Learning objectives written with measurable verbs (avoid "understand"; prefer
      "identify," "differentiate," "recommend").
- [ ] Imaging consent / de-identification verified for all cases.
- [ ] Disclosure slide includes industry relationships, advisory roles, prior publications
      cited.
- [ ] Mentor pre-review completed (typical 1–2 weeks before).

## 3. Conference talk (RSNA / ECR / KCR / society meeting)

**Audience**: Specialist peers; high domain expertise.
**Time**: 7–12 min present + 2–3 min Q&A (oral session standard).
**Tone**: Tight, data-dense, focused on contribution.
**Slide count**: ~10–14 for 10-min talk; ~14–18 for 12-min (1 slide / 45–60 s).

### Section structure

| # | Section | Slides | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title + Disclosure | 1 | Title, authors, affiliation, COI in 1 slide |
| 2 | Background + Gap | 1–2 | Tight: 1 sentence on context, 1 on gap |
| 3 | Hypothesis / Aim | 1 | Stated as a sentence-headline |
| 4 | Methods | 1–2 | Cohort flow diagram + key methodological choice |
| 5 | Primary results | 2–3 | One figure per result; sentence-headline title |
| 6 | Subgroup / sensitivity | 1 | Only if it's the most defensible secondary finding |
| 7 | Limitations | 1 | Brief — acknowledge top 2–3 |
| 8 | Conclusions | 1 | 1 sentence; mirrors abstract conclusion |
| 9 | Acknowledgments | 1 | Funding, collaborators, departmental support |

### Design seed
- **Color**: One accent for primary result; everything else neutral.
- **Typography**: ≥ 24 pt body throughout (auditorium projection).
- **Figures**: Re-render journal figures for slide context (drop methodological detail,
  enlarge axis labels, direct-label series). RSNA / ECR projection rooms project at 1080p
  — vector PDFs preferred.
- **Speaker pace**: 130–150 words/min for academic delivery; rehearse to ensure last
  slide arrives at 9:30 of a 10-min slot.

### Pre-presentation checklist
- [ ] Abstract was accepted for oral (not poster) — confirm slot type and time.
- [ ] Audience response system not used (oral sessions don't typically include ARS).
- [ ] Submitted disclosure to society (society disclosures often separate from manuscript
      COI).
- [ ] Backup slide stack for top-3 anticipated questions ready.

## 4. Lecture / didactic (residents, course material)

**Audience**: Trainees in structured curriculum (radiology residents, fellows, medical
students).
**Time**: 50–60 min (full lecture slot).
**Tone**: Pedagogical, build-up, recap-friendly.
**Slide count**: ~30–40 (1 slide / 90–120 s, with worked examples and recap slides).

### Section structure

| # | Section | Slides | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title + Lecture position in curriculum | 1 | "Lecture 4 of 12: Body MRI series" |
| 2 | Learning objectives | 1 | Mapped to curriculum competencies |
| 3 | Recap of prior lecture | 1–2 | Where we were last time |
| 4 | Today's roadmap | 1 | 3–5 sections previewed |
| 5 | Section 1: Concept | 3–5 | Build-up + worked example + check-for-understanding |
| 6 | Section 2: Concept | 3–5 | Same pattern |
| 7 | ... | | |
| 8 | Synthesis / decision algorithm | 2–3 | How sections connect into clinical workflow |
| 9 | Self-assessment questions | 2–3 | 3–5 multiple-choice with answer reveal |
| 10 | Take-home messages | 1 | Map back to learning objectives |
| 11 | Pre-reading for next lecture | 1 | Specific paper / textbook chapter |
| 12 | References + further reading | 1 | Curated list, not exhaustive |

### Design seed
- **Color**: Course palette consistent across all lectures in series.
- **Typography**: Title 28 pt / body 20 pt. Build-up animations acceptable for stepwise
  concept introduction.
- **Figures**: Mix of textbook diagrams, original imaging, SMART Servier icons. Reusable
  asset library across lecture series (per `pptx-mac-compatibility` rule — single asset
  source).
- **Recap pattern**: At each section end, a 1-slide recap before moving on. Helps
  trainees with weaker prior knowledge.
- **Self-assessment**: Use audience-response polling if classroom supports it; otherwise
  show MCQ → pause → reveal answer + explanation slide.

### Pre-presentation checklist
- [ ] Lecture position in curriculum confirmed (not duplicating prior lecture content).
- [ ] Self-assessment questions mapped to learning objectives.
- [ ] Pre-reading assignment matches the lecture's prerequisites.
- [ ] Course-level branding consistent (logo, color, font).

## 5. Academic lecture — multi-paper survey (graduate course)

**Audience**: Graduate students from mixed disciplines (basic science, clinical,
imaging, AI). Cross-disciplinary background; a single specialty's jargon will not
land for everyone.
**Time**: 30–45 min present + 5–10 min Q&A.
**Tone**: Narrative arc across multiple papers; one *lighthouse* paper per section
anchors the discussion, surrounding papers add nuance.
**Slide count**: ~35–50 (1 slide / 45–75 s, with section dividers + transitions).

### Section structure — 4-act narrative

| # | Section | Slides | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title slide | 1 | Course position, instructor, date, presenter, affiliation |
| 2 | Outline (TOC) | 1 | 4 sections with time budgets visible |
| 3 | Glossary (optional) | 1 | Tier 1: disease/concept · Tier 2: method/stats abbreviations |
| 4 | Section 1 divider | 1 | "History" / "Background" — full-bleed deep navy |
| 5 | Section 1 content | 4–6 | Founding papers, original observations, classical concepts |
| 6 | Transition slide | 1 | Large coral quotes + one-sentence question motivating next act |
| 7 | Section 2 divider | 1 | "Concept" / "Classification" |
| 8 | Section 2 content | 5–8 | Modern framework, definitions, what we now know |
| 9 | Transition slide | 1 | Bridge to mechanism |
| 10 | Section 3 divider | 1 | "Mechanism" — typically the longest, anchored by 1–2 lighthouse papers |
| 11 | Section 3 content | 10–14 | Lighthouse paper figures, mechanistic details, 2024–2026 updates |
| 12 | Transition slide | 1 | Bridge to clinical translation |
| 13 | Section 4 divider | 1 | "Clinical translation" |
| 14 | Section 4 content | 6–10 | Diagnostic application, therapy, ongoing trials |
| 15 | Wrap-up / Take-home | 1–2 | 3 bullets max, mirrored to outline |
| 16 | Acknowledgments / Q&A | 1 | Funding, mentor thanks, contact |

### Design seed

- **Visual style**: Nature/Lancet — see `slide_visual_styles/nature_lancet.md`
- **Body language**: English only (per `~/.claude/rules/academic-lecture-style.md` §1)
- **Speaker notes**: narrative, in the user's preferred language (English by default; a Korean narrative register is supported for Korean presenters), 150–300 chars / slide
- **Section dividers**: full-bleed `#121D36` background + coral accent strip + `{N} MIN`
  badge bottom-right
- **Transition slides**: large coral curly quotes (72pt) flanking a 36pt white question
- **Lighthouse paper anchor**: each section names one anchor paper in the divider
  subtitle; section content slides reference it in eyebrow text

### Pre-presentation checklist

- [ ] All `--` em-dashes verified rendering correctly on Mac PowerPoint
- [ ] TIFF images converted to PNG (per `pptx-mac-compatibility.md` §1)
- [ ] `<a:sp3d>` 3D bevel = 0 (per `pptx-mac-compatibility.md`)
- [ ] `app.xml` Slides/Notes counts patched (per `pptx-mac-compatibility.md` §5)
- [ ] Speaker notes parsed for `**bold**` / `*italic*` markdown (per §4)
- [ ] 40-min timing rehearsal completed (longest section flagged)
- [ ] Glossary slide present if audience is multidisciplinary
- [ ] Each section has ≥1 lighthouse paper figure (not text-only)
- [ ] PDF export visually verified (figure positions, font fallback)
- [ ] Mac PowerPoint actual-rendering check (PDF alone misses some defects)

### Reference implementation

- Build script: `templates/build_pptx_nature_lancet.py` (this skill) — `add_title_slide`,
  `add_toc_slide`, `add_glossary_slide`, `add_section_divider`, `add_transition_slide`,
  `add_content_slide`, `add_closing_slide` + `fix_app_xml` helper
- Style spec: `slide_visual_styles/nature_lancet.md`
- Example deck: 47-slide academic lecture (4-section narrative across 17 lighthouse papers
  + supporting references), Mac PowerPoint verified
