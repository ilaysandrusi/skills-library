"""Backup slides are not part of the talk, so they are not part of its clock.

Nearly every conference deck carries a backup section — the Q&A slides you do not present
and open only if someone asks. The budget check counted them against the clock, so a
10-minute talk with four backup slides was told to cut, and the honest way to satisfy the
tool was to delete the Q&A preparation. That is the tool being wrong in the one place a
speaker most needs to be prepared.

The clock now stops at the first slide marked "Backup" / "Appendix" / "Q&A" / "백업".
Density and type size still apply past that line — a backup slide is shown *under
questioning*, which is the worst possible moment to find out it is a wall of 11-pt text.

Skips cleanly (exit 0) without python-pptx. Network-free.
