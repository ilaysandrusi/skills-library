## 1. Descriptive Statistics

### Template
Continuous variables were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) depending on data distribution, which was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages. Baseline characteristics were compared between groups using {the independent t test or Mann-Whitney U test} for continuous variables and {the chi-square test or Fisher exact test} for categorical variables, as appropriate.

### When to use each
- **Mean +/- SD**: normally distributed continuous data.
- **Median [IQR]**: skewed distributions, ordinal data, or small samples.
- **Shapiro-Wilk**: preferred normality test for n < 50; for larger samples, also consider visual inspection (Q-Q plot, histogram).

## 2. Comparison Tests

### Two-Group Continuous (Parametric)
Differences in {outcome} between {group A} and {group B} were compared using the independent-samples t test. For paired data (e.g., pre- vs post-intervention in the same subjects), the paired t test was used.

### Two-Group Continuous (Nonparametric)
Differences in {outcome} between groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples.

### Categorical
The association between {variable 1} and {variable 2} was evaluated using the chi-square test. Fisher exact test was used when the expected cell count was less than 5.

### Multi-Group
Differences in {outcome} among {3+} groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc pairwise comparisons using the Tukey honestly significant difference test. For non-normally distributed data, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used with post hoc Dunn test.

## 3. Diagnostic Accuracy

### Template
Diagnostic performance of {model/reader/test} was evaluated by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated with 95% CIs using the DeLong method. The operating point was determined by {maximizing the Youden index / using a pre-specified sensitivity threshold of X% / clinical consensus}. AUC values were compared between {model A} and {model B} using the DeLong test for correlated ROC curves.

### Sensitivity/Specificity at Fixed Threshold
At the pre-specified operating point of {threshold}, sensitivity and specificity were calculated with 95% CIs using the exact binomial method.

### Multi-Class
For multiclass classification, per-class sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a one-versus-rest approach. The overall performance was summarized using the macro-averaged AUC.

## 4. Inter-Rater Agreement

### Two Raters, Categorical
Inter-rater agreement between {rater 1} and {rater 2} was assessed using Cohen kappa coefficient. Kappa values were interpreted as follows: less than 0, poor; 0-0.20, slight; 0.21-0.40, fair; 0.41-0.60, moderate; 0.61-0.80, substantial; and 0.81-1.00, almost perfect agreement.

### Multiple Raters, Categorical
Inter-rater agreement among {N} raters was assessed using Fleiss kappa with 95% CIs.

### Continuous Measurements
Inter-rater reliability for continuous measurements was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with a two-way random-effects model for absolute agreement (ICC[2,1] for single measures, ICC[2,k] for average measures). ICC values were interpreted as: less than 0.50, poor; 0.50-0.75, moderate; 0.75-0.90, good; and greater than 0.90, excellent.

### Weighted Kappa (Ordinal)
For ordinal ratings, inter-rater agreement was assessed using the weighted kappa coefficient with quadratic weights.

## 5. Survival Analysis

### Template
Overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups using the log-rank test. Median survival times were reported with 95% CIs. Multivariable analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model, reporting hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. The proportional hazards assumption was verified using Schoenfeld residuals. Variables with P < .10 on univariable analysis were included in the multivariable model.

### Template (Retrospective Cohort — Time Zero + Interval Censoring)
Time zero was defined as the date of the first {qualifying examination / treatment / enrollment}. {Outcome} status was ascertained at subsequent {screening visits / follow-up examinations}, and the exact date of {outcome} onset was unknown. Therefore, the time to {outcome} was interval-censored between the last {negative / event-free} examination and the first {positive / event-detected} examination. Participants who remained {event-free / negative} at the last available examination were right-censored at that date. Standard Kaplan-Meier estimates were reported for comparability with prior literature, and interval-censored analyses using the Turnbull nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator were performed as {primary analysis / sensitivity analysis}.

### Template (Competing Risks)
Cumulative incidence of {primary outcome} was estimated using the cumulative incidence function (CIF), accounting for {competing event, e.g., non-cardiovascular death} as a competing risk. Group differences in cumulative incidence were compared using Gray test. The association between covariates and {primary outcome} was assessed using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model, reporting subdistribution hazard ratios (sHRs) with 95% CIs. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models were also fitted for etiologic interpretation.

## 6. Sample Size Justification

### Template (Diagnostic Accuracy)
Based on an expected AUC of {X} for the AI model with a null hypothesis AUC of 0.50, a minimum of {N} cases ({n} positive, {n} negative) were required to achieve 80% power at a two-sided significance level of .05, using the method described by Hanley and McNeil. Accounting for {X%} expected data loss, a target enrollment of {N} was set.

### Template (Comparison Study)
To detect a difference of {X} in {metric} between {group A} and {group B}, assuming a standard deviation of {Y}, a sample of {N} per group was required to achieve {80/90}% power at a two-sided alpha of .05 using a {two-sample t test / chi-square test}. This calculation was performed using {software}.

### Template (No Formal Power Analysis)
No formal sample size calculation was performed for this {retrospective / exploratory} study. All eligible patients during the study period were included.

## 7. Multiple Comparison Correction

### Bonferroni
To account for multiple comparisons across {N} primary endpoints, a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of P < {0.05/N} was applied.

### Holm
Multiple comparisons were adjusted using the Holm-Bonferroni sequential correction method.

### False Discovery Rate
For exploratory analyses involving {N} comparisons, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control the false discovery rate at 5%.

### No Correction (with justification)
Given that the {subgroup / secondary} analyses were pre-specified and hypothesis-driven, no correction for multiple comparisons was applied; these results should be interpreted with appropriate caution.

Figures were generated using matplotlib {version} and seaborn {version}.

### Template (R-primary)
Statistical analyses were performed using R {version} (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Key packages included pROC for ROC analysis, survival and survminer for survival analysis, irr for inter-rater reliability, and ggplot2 for visualization.

### Template (Mixed)

All statistical tests were two-sided, and P < .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

### Significance Statement (append to any software template)
All statistical tests were two-sided, and P < .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference unless otherwise specified.
