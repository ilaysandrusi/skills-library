## Materials and Methods

### 4.1 Study Design
- Retrospective vs prospective.
- Single-center vs multicenter.
- Development vs validation vs both.
- Dates of data collection.
- If development+validation: describe the temporal or geographic separation.

### 4.2 Dataset

#### Source and Collection
- Institution(s), imaging modality, date range.
- How cases were identified (consecutive, sampled, queried).
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria (be specific).

#### Dataset Splitting (for development studies)
- Training / validation / test split ratios and method.
- **Critical**: confirm patient-level splitting (not image or exam level).
- Temporal split preferred over random split (state which was used).
- If external test set: describe source and independence.

#### Dataset Characteristics
- Total cases, positive/negative distribution.
- Demographics: age, sex, relevant clinical variables.
- Image characteristics: scanner models, protocols, acquisition parameters.
- Case complexity distribution if relevant.

### 4.3 Reference Standard
- How ground truth was established (pathology, follow-up, expert consensus, clinical diagnosis).
- Number of annotators, their experience level.
- Annotation process: independent reading, consensus, adjudication.
- Blinding: annotators blinded to model output and clinical information?
- Inter-annotator agreement reported (kappa, ICC).
- Timing between index test and reference standard.

### 4.4 AI Model

#### For Traditional DL Models
- Architecture (e.g., ResNet-50, U-Net, YOLO v8) with citation.
- Input: image size, preprocessing steps (normalization, augmentation).
- Training: optimizer, learning rate (schedule), batch size, epochs, early stopping criteria.
- Loss function.
- Hardware: GPU model, training time.
- Framework and version (PyTorch 2.x, TensorFlow 2.x).

#### For LLM/MLLM Studies
- Model name and version (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro).
- API access date range (models change over time).
- Temperature and other generation parameters.
- Prompt design: system prompt, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought.
- Full prompts in supplement (or verbatim in methods if short).
- If multi-agent: agent roles, interaction protocol, consensus mechanism.
- Input format: text-only, image+text, structured data.
- For report-text extraction: list each supplied text field separately (e.g., findings, impression,
  clinical history, indication, prior diagnosis, referral text). State whether fields that may contain the
  target label were masked, excluded, or evaluated in a sensitivity analysis.
- For fine-tuning, LoRA, prompt-engineering, or multi-agent claims: include a same-backbone zero-shot or
  few-shot comparator using the identical input fields, output schema, and test split.

#### For Pipeline/System Studies
- End-to-end system description.
- Each stage: input, processing, output.
- Decision points and thresholds.
- Human-in-the-loop components.

### 4.5 Comparators (if applicable)
- Reader study design: number of readers, experience levels, subspecialty.
- Reading conditions: blinding, clinical information provided, time constraints.
- AI-assisted vs unassisted reading protocol.
- Washout period between reading sessions.

### 4.6 Statistical Analysis
- **Primary metric**: AUC, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 -- state which and why.
- **Confidence intervals**: 95% CIs for all primary metrics (bootstrap or exact binomial).
- **Comparison tests**: DeLong test for AUC comparison, McNemar for sensitivity/specificity.
- **Adaptation ablation**: when claiming benefit from fine-tuning, LoRA, prompt design, or a wrapper,
  pre-specify the paired comparison against the same-backbone zero-shot/few-shot baseline and report the
  uncertainty for the delta, not only the adapted model's standalone performance.
- **Input-contamination sensitivity**: for NLP/LLM extraction, report the primary analysis with the
  pre-specified input fields and, when applicable, a sensitivity analysis excluding fields likely to
  contain the answer.
- **Calibration**: calibration plot, Brier score, calibration slope/intercept (for prediction models).
- **Subgroup analyses**: pre-specified subgroups with rationale.
- **Multiple comparisons**: correction method if applicable.
- **Sample size**: justification or power analysis if prospective.
- **Software**: version numbers for all statistical packages.

### 4.7 Ethics
- IRB approval with protocol number.
- Informed consent status.
- Data de-identification method.

## Discussion

> **Before writing:** Collect anchor papers and user input via SKILL.md Phase 5a
> interactive planning gate.

### Paragraph 1: Summary
- Restate key findings without repeating exact numbers.
- Frame in context of the study aim.

### Paragraphs 2-3: Performance in Context (anchor paper driven)
- Organize around anchor papers provided by the user.
- For each anchor paper: state their result → compare with ours → explain discrepancy.
- Compare to prior models on the same task (cite specific AUC/accuracy from prior studies).
- Compare to human reader performance (if applicable).
- Explain performance differences: data, methodology, population.

### Paragraph 4: Clinical Deployment Implications
- Where in the workflow would this fit? (triage, second reader, standalone, quality assurance)
- What is the intended use case?
- What decision, workflow step, or downstream action changes if the model is correct? State this before
  making a clinical-utility claim.
- Implementation considerations: speed, hardware, integration.
- Regulatory pathway considerations (if relevant).

### Paragraph 5: Limitations
Typical AI study limitations to address honestly:
1. Retrospective design and selection bias.
2. Single-center / limited generalizability.
3. Reference standard limitations (imperfect ground truth).
4. Dataset size and class imbalance.
5. Temporal/geographic bias (training and test from same distribution).
6. For LLMs: model version changes, non-reproducibility, API dependency.
7. No prospective clinical validation.
8. No assessment of clinical outcome impact.
For each: (a) what it is, (b) how mitigated, (c) direction of residual bias.

### Conclusion
- One to two sentences: main finding and primary clinical implication.
- Must be a citable statement — memorable and specific.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Data leakage**: Preprocessing (normalization statistics) computed on full dataset before splitting.
2. **Image-level splitting**: Splitting by image rather than by patient allows the same patient in train and test.
3. **Missing CIs**: Reporting AUC = 0.95 without confidence interval is incomplete.
4. **No calibration**: AUC measures discrimination only; calibration is essential for prediction models.
5. **Overclaiming**: "Our model outperformed radiologists" when CIs overlap or test set is small.
6. **Missing error analysis**: Knowing where the model fails is as important as overall metrics.
7. **Vague prompts**: For LLM studies, not providing the exact prompts used.
8. **No intended use**: Not specifying where in the clinical workflow the model would be deployed.
9. **Cherry-picked operating point**: Choosing the threshold that looks best on the test set.
10. **Ignoring prevalence**: Reporting PPV/NPV without discussing the study prevalence vs real-world prevalence.
11. **Input-text contamination**: clinical history, indication, impression, or referral text contains the target diagnosis or label.
12. **Missing same-backbone baseline**: fine-tuning or prompt-engineering benefit is claimed without a zero-shot/few-shot comparator on the same task.
13. **Presence-only novelty**: the Introduction says the task is novel but does not position the work against the closest 2-3 prior papers or systems.
