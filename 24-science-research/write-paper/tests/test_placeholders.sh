# Introduction

Our method follows prior work [@NEW:competing-risk-model].

We used [version] of the model via the [channel] interface.

TODO: rewrite this. See FIXME below; values still XXX.

Data are at https://example.com/data and doi.org/XXXX, link here [URL].

This cites a source [4] in Vancouver style [5-7].

# clean: code-fence guard + legit DOI + numbered reference list (no body markers)
cat > "$WORK/clean.md" <<'EOF'
# Methods

We analyzed the cohort using a competing-risk model.

```python
# TODO: inside a code fence, must be ignored
url = "https://example.com/ignored"
ref = [1]  # ignored
EOF
printf '```\n' >> "$WORK/clean.md"
cat >> "$WORK/clean.md" <<'EOF'
