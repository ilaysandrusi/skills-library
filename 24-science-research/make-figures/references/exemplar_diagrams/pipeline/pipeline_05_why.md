# Why this exemplar is good — pipeline_05 (pipeline / tasks illustration)

Hierarchy / structure: Two stacked panels (A and B), each a four-column table-like layout. A shows report generation for two cases (pelvic radiograph and abdominal CT) side-by-side: input → reference report → generated report. B shows VQA with closed-ended vs. open-ended question variants for each case. The uniform column structure makes the cross-row comparison immediate.

Whitespace & balance: Narrow column gutters (not wasteful) but generous vertical spacing between cases. Each row reads as a discrete case study.

Typography (font size, weight, alignment): The strongest typographic choice is the use of colored highlights on specific phrases in the generated reports — green for confirmed findings, red for hallucinated content, orange for partial matches. This converts what would be plain prose into an annotated diff without extra legend burden, provided the reader notices the color key.

Emphasis (which elements are visually strongest, why): The color-annotated report text is the primary didactic payload and is the strongest element, correctly. The input images serve as context and are sized accordingly smaller.

Color usage: Color communicates semantic agreement/disagreement in text — a rare and effective use. Panel A uses gray scaffolding (headers, borders) to keep attention on the colored content.

Weaknesses (if any — nothing is perfect): Red and green are the primary discriminators, which is not colorblind-safe. A shape or weight encoding (bold for hallucinations) would make it more accessible. Font size of the report text is small; readability at small figure widths could suffer.
