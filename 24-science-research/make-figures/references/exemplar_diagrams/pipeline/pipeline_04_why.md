# Why this exemplar is good — pipeline_04 (pipeline)

Hierarchy / structure: Top row is the macro view (modality inputs → encoder → connector → LLM → generator → outputs), bottom row zooms into the "connector" block with four named variants (A MLP, B Q-Former, C MH-Attn, D Expert Captioning). A light-blue downward arrow visually tethers the macro block to its expansion — the classic "zoom-in detail" device applied cleanly.

Whitespace & balance: Even horizontal spacing between connector variants. The expanded lower panel is framed in a subtle tinted rectangle that contains it without drawing attention.

Typography (font size, weight, alignment): Consistent sans-serif labels throughout. Capital letters A/B/C/D tag the four variants in one size; component labels (MLP, Q-Former, MH-Attn) use the same type family as the macro row for continuity.

Emphasis (which elements are visually strongest, why): The central LLM box is the largest and darkest block — correctly, because this is the figure's conceptual center. The connector variants underneath share equal weight, communicating their parallel status as alternatives rather than a sequence.

Color usage: Restrained three-tone palette (blue for neural modules, orange for learnable queries/tokens, gray for data I/O). Dashed outlines mark optional/repeated elements. Colorblind-safe.

Weaknesses (if any — nothing is perfect): Many modality icons (image/audio/video) repeat at both input and output; a single output cluster would reduce clutter. The Q/K/V labels inside panel C are small relative to neighboring elements.
